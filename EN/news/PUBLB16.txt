	550C0128	Same sex marriage bill debated
	B9D25873	It's tough being a godless liberal in a theocracy, but it's about to get even worse if Congress has its way. "Everyone should be able to get married," says Phil Kensington of the American Society of Same Sex, "I want to marry my life partner, who is a 79 year old man, but very wealthy, and I am 26 and love to club and we have a great time. If we don't marry, how can I ride this old git for a couple of years, cringing every time he slobbers on me and calls it a kiss, just so I can take his millions?"
