	6F4D7BCB	Dawkins used connections in the market to leverage his way onto Ochoa's ticket by providing financing through contacts in the hedge fund world. Contacts who now ensure the city is run to support the rich and keep money out of schools and into government-funded spying programs through a complicated conspiracy I don't quite have the space to explain here. As usual, it's just another example of the big attacking the small and the rich using power systems to destroy the aspirations of the poor.

The bloody side effects of the recent legislation pushed through by Border Agents Love Land Security are very clear. A group of wealthy civil liberties donors gathered recently in downtown Liberty City to discuss the problem. "People from other countries are simple, and as rich white liberals we must coddle them, treat them like babies, nurture them, patronize them. Not everyone is as sophisticated and well-educated as us, which really is a pity," said web 2.0 entrepreneur Clive Lettington.

	41439FB8	We appear to have elected a fascist into City Hall. Worse, we have elected an idiot. Even worse, they are the same man. Deputy Mayor, Bryce Dawkins, made comments that would make your average village idiot blush when he attempted to link gay rights to global terrorism, economic collapse and America's supposed imminent downfall. His subsequent attempts to deflect the criticism show what an awful and pathetic little toad he really is. So the question is; how did this man get into a position of power? And the answer, of course, is big business.
