	88A0ED48	In an effort to understand the growing meth threat to Liberty City, local narcotics agents have taken the mobile meth lab seized in the Steinway section and have it up and operational for educational purposes only. Agent Albert Thomas told reporters that law enforcement will not fully understand the threat they face unless they replicate the process of making and smoking the drug.

	9DE71DA6	Controversial deputy mayor, Bryce Dawkins, has been causing offense again - and standing up for family values - in a speech yesterday that has outraged liberals and gay rights groups. Mr. Dawkins, who has long attacked what he terms "the culture of vice that grips our city like an addiction", has attacked gay and lesbian groups as "undermining the family values that make this nation great." He added, "These are the kind of people who make our enemies laugh at us, and are directly contributing to the security problems we all face. Civil rights activists called his comments "prehistoric" and "half witted, but what do people expect from a man called Bryce, whose parents were first cousins?" Mr. Dawkins was unavailable for comment.

Crime is currently spiraling out of control in the city at the moment, and a tough hand on the tiller is what's needed. We wish him well!
	347F759F	Deputy Police Commissioner Francis McReary has been speaking to reporters at the LCPD media day about becoming Commissioner next year taking over from the retiring Mitt Fitzsimmons. One of several possible candidates, McReary's tireless work for the community and even more tireless promotion of that work have seen him emerge as the leading contender for the city's most important law enforcement job.

Soon you will find that you can't have normal sex," he explained. "Yes, and soon you really want to be dominated," Albert added. "When I don't have crystal dick," chuckled Macelton, "Nothing derails a good aggro fuck like crystal dick."
