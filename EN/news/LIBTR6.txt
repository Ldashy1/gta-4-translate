Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins told the Liberty Tree, "When terrorists want to bomb something, you take it away and they won't want to bomb it anymore. That's the way to protect our families and family values." The BAWSAQ has been dropping as concerns about the terror scare affect markets around the world. "These terrorists want to take away our freedoms. But look, we've done it for them." said Dawkins.

	7BD708F0	Liberty City's Police Commissioner for Public Affairs, Tom Pireni, responded yesterday to the recent explosion in violent crime by laying the blame squarely at the feet of those who try to stop the police from doing their job better: the general public. He commented that, "The police don't get the respect they deserve and, quite frankly, never have. We do a very dangerous job, and have a lot of quotas to fill. To blame police priorities for rising crime is patently absurd. When arresting jay walkers or protecting film sets around the city, our officers are more than willing to get involved in any violent incidents that occur. The fact is that stopping violent crime does not put any money into this city's coffers, whereas annoying motorists is very lucrative and ensures our pensions remain intact."
