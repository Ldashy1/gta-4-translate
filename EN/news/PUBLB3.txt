	BA46AA63	Announcing his plans at a poorly-attended press conference yesterday, he said, "This is radio 2.0, this is Lazlow 2.0, I'm back." When asked to explain what on earth this could mean, the popular shock jock said, "I don't really know - it's up to you, the listeners, to decide.' We will stay on this story in the hope this guy makes something of himself.

	08624699	A blast from the past today as former talk show host Lazlow is trying to get back on the airwaves. Lazlow used to host a popular show on a station called Chatterbox at the turn of the millennium, then things turned bad for him and he disappeared from our airwaves after a string of personal humiliations and bad choices, including several payola scandals, and a series of sexual shenanigans led to major credibility issues. But it appears he is back. Or trying to get back. He's been trying to raise financing for a new radio station to be launched in Liberty City in which the listener is put right into the action.
