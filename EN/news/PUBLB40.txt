	AA3C5716	As the debate in Congress rages on over illegal immigration, many activists are saying that America should continue an open door policy. "People have been coming here for hundreds of years," said Immigration Reform Center President Percy Simonson, "Who are we to close the door suddenly? Everyone in the world is an American. Come join us. Come live here. Do like we do and don't pay tax! We have no traffic or congestion problems. There is room for all." Liberals held a The Laws Don't Matter Day on Capitol Hill and protested lawmakers' attempts to enforce existing laws.
