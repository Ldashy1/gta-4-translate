	7157F2DF	The racists and snobs who run Liberty City once sacked Martin Hawes because he was clinically insane and wore a bra to work. Now, they are discussing an idea he came up with from his lunatic asylum bed. Why? Because, if the idea helps them make more money, they don't care where it comes from. And his idea? Re-close the bridges and tunnels. The reason? To ease traffic and keep the poor out. Only those who could afford speedboats would be able to function normally in the city. It is the proposal of a lunatic. It would keep the rich in, and the poor out. No wonder it is an idea people are actually discussing.
