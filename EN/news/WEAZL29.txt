	B27626BF	Good news for our fragile wealthy
	93BC22F4	Under Attack Again
	85FEAA1B	Witnesses saw a "foreign looking man" walking away from the warehouse. What more evidence does the President need before the borders are shut to America-hating immigrants?
	F2C270AF	While this is bad news for some, it's good news for us as we are big supporters of those who help themselves. Especially when those who help themselves are the already wealthy figuring out a way to stay rich. Above all, good house prices are good for us as we have literally nothing else to talk about over dinner. We grew up in the 1980s after all, so missed out on hippies and swinging and ideas.

	052A2874	Despite our repeated warnings, terrorists have attacked Liberty City again. This time the target was a fueling depot in Northwood. Some liberal news outlets are trying to spin this into a story about the Mafia. They're saying that the explosion was related to organized crime rather than terror. These leftist loons are crazy. They'll say and do anything before they admit that terrorism is the number one problem facing the nation and much more important than any of their pet projects, the environment, health care and ludicrous foreign welfare projects.
	78340E86	Even more alarming, the LCPD forensic team has found a triggering device at the scene which may have been activated by a cell phone. It is more than likely that this was just the first of many planned bombings. If you see a foreigner using a cell phone, he is probably a terrorist. Act first, ask questions later. You have the safety of your fellow Americans to consider as well as your own.
	2F670251	Ochoa ignores Weazel warnings
	2CA36474	Proof that the government is doing all that it can to protect home owners and families came through from Liberty City with the news that, in a city in which not much goes right, the cost of living remains reassuringly high. Although the city is plagued by social problems, and has a massive shortfall of strip malls and obesity compared with rest of this great nation, at least they are keeping the economy strong.
