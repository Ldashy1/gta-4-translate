	8DF9A292	Well, it's finally over. The King has won and Rome is burning. The conservatives have had their way and the constitution is in shambles. With the renewal of the Jingoism Act, EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO will be monitored. There are 300 million people in America and a reported 300 million people will need to be hired to track the every movement of every American. These are scary times and I am so glad to be a liberal journalist who doesn't interject her personal feelings into stories. The blogosphere is the only thing that can save us from this tyranny.
