	A84453B4	Bridge To Terror?
	786E47EB	I've written recently about the potential link between online dating and terrorism. Now sociologists warn of a new danger - depression. Apparently desperados cannot handle it when they discover the person they met at <a href="www.love-meet.net">love-meet.net</a> lied about themselves in order to hoodwink the unsuspecting into a date. What a surprise? Lie online? Who would have thought of that? I never have, because I'm a conservative and we don't lie, but I know most people do.

If Liberty City is attacked again, the United States will respond in kind. We will start throwing darts at a map and bomb any country we hit, only stopping when we feel satisfied. Arbitrary violence must be met with arbitrary violence.

	060958F9	The link between depression and terrorism is well known, with most terrorists also being depressives and vice versa. It's a natural consequence of the liberal hegemony and the decline in civil society since the 60s 'me' generation ruined our society and gave our enemies hope. Hope that I would crush out of them with a bomb, just as I would bomb all of those awful online dating sites and make people learn proper social skills and proper manners. This is a war America, and it's a war I intend to win. It's a war on cowardice, and it will be the subject of my next book.

Commuter groups and government agencies are at war over the matter. Officials contend that anything that could be a target should be shut down by martial law. Mayor Ochoa has suggested the possibility of these bridges reopening despite the inevitable bloody consequences. Is this a fair price to pay for increased convenience?
