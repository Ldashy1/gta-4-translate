	557E69B6	The National Library Center is shutting down - as are all libraries nationwide - in a conspiracy by big chain computer stores and Bean Machine to make all information electronic so that the government can more easily read everything you do or say. With GPS devices in all mobile phones, the government can pinpoint your exact location at any time.

	E430CC69	The increase of the terror threat level is another example of the National Office of Security Enforcement's sensationalism and willingness to limit our civil liberties. The money they have invested in putting a PR spin on public fears could have been invested in recycling and urban community composting schemes.
	ADFF6007	Additionally, they have increased unconstitutional car inspections on the Broker Bridge. I was stopped on my way back to South Slopes after a trip to Vespucci University to pick up a pound of marijuana. Tempted to keep going, I eventually decided to stop for these fascists. What right does this fascist cop have to pull me over and inspect my trunk? Screw you, pig!

	472FCD19	After a Freedom of Information Act request to the FIB, I found out that they had done surveillance on me and found out that I liked to visit trannies under the Broker Bridge. It is inexcusable that the government is reading my blog TranEELuvr. It is this kind of surveillance state that will bring this country down.
