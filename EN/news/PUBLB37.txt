	4614AA22	Our kids don't have much to look up to anymore. I work tirelessly with civic groups and politicians to ban video games, indecent words in movies, tobacco billboards, skateboarding, teen sex and eating meat that isn't free range. So when I want to take my kid to a baseball game and he sees these overpaid losers down there full of chemicals, what am I supposed to tell him? That mommy is on Ampheterate since starting therapy years ago? That daddy has to take a Mollis in order to bypass his biological response to throw up on my saggy tits? That we sneak gin martinis at lunch? What? These players deserve to be fired.
