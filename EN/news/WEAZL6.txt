	B6875705	In a bold and courageous move by city and federal officials, bridges and tunnels will be closed indefinitely while officials root out what is rumored to be a terror cell in Liberty City. While activists and other un-Americans have questioned the war on terror, to those who have died at the hands of police during protests, it is quite clear. "These terrorists want to take away our freedoms. But look, we've done it for them. Ha. We win. You lose. Eat my shit terrorists. Yeah, you like that? Do you? Daddy is in charge," said Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins. Income from tolls has dropped to zero, and officials say that bankruptcy is a small price to pay for safety. The stock market won't crash.

And only weak-minded liberals are afraid to discuss the causes of this crime wave - immigration. As usual, the liberal elite are banging on about the causes of crime - our right to bear arms, not immigration. Anyone with half a brain knows gun control should be relaxed in this city immediately so people can defend themselves from the border jumpers.
