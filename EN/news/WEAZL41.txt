	053FB18B	Since we were stupid enough to reopen the bridges around the metropolitan area, traffic has got much worse. At the same time, terrorists are now running wild about the city, in incredible numbers, we imagine. Next time you are on a bridge, look around you. Those other cars are full of terrorists, trying to blow up our freedom.
	227EEC09	Well, beat them to it. Restrict your own freedom and help the environment, if you care about that sort of nonsense - support the proposals to shut the bridges permanently. These radical ideas were suggested by Martin Hawes, a man so freethinking the liberals locked him up. We say close the lunatic asylums. Turn them into detention centers for undesirables of a different sort, and close the bridges now.
