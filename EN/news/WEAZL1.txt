	F7AC3C83	Dirty Bomb Threat
	03B8D41F	Could detonate at any moment
	104E90E4	Anti-terrorism police battled angry residents and public opinion as they shut bridges and tunnels in an effort to protect freedom and democracy after an Internet rumor blog warned of an impending dirty bomb attack in Liberty City.
