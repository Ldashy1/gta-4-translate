	F2F56E5B	Another Online Revolution!
	DFBDE6AD	Bridges Open
	A0C1EBD7	The bridge and tunnel crossings between Algonquin and Alderney were finally reopened yesterday as the terror threat caused by the mismanagement of the war on terror was deemed to have sufficiently reduced enough to allow us to carry on destroying the planet by the burning of fossil fuels. It's global warming stupid. It's a win - win for big business as usual. As income from the war goes down, oil revenues go up as people start increasing their carbon footprint again.

	72760F40	We are all doomed, living in a low-lying coastal city, but while the government willfully refuses to consider outlawing cars or energy, we might as well drown ourselves. Future generations will hate us even more than we hate ourselves, and the fact is they will be right.
	51E8969B	Every revolution needs a name, and this one is 2.0. Web 2.0 is so amazing that what most people don't realize is that there never was a dotcom bubble. Web 2.0 is the second generation. You are probably still living in your Web 1.0 land - never even aware that everything has evolved, passed you by and left you for dead. You are old. You are becoming irrelevant. Kids look at you with disgust. You are living in an information silo while the rest of us are 26-7 Internet 2.0. When I shit, it is automatically recorded on my blog, an RSS feed is sent out, my <a href="www.grype.org">www.grype.org</a> buddies are notified, and it goes out to the <a href="www.myroomonline.net">www.myroomonline.net</a> community. It's a revolution. I have thousands of friends I've never met. I am so alone. The darkness is closing in.
