	BC2DB436	Another shipment of cloned medication was intercepted at the docks today. The haul included counterfeit drugs used to treat depression and erectile dysfunction. A spokesman for Betta Pharmaceuticals, producer of the erectile dysfunction treatment drug, Mollis, has warned of the harmful effects of cloned medication. "Not only do these actions undermine the economy, but they can be very dangerous. We spend years putting our drugs through clinical trials and giving lab monkeys exploding erections. These guys brew something up in their basement and illegally ship it into the marketplace." Last year, a man in Las Venturas took some cloned Mollis and accidentally killed his wife when the toxic brew caused him to experience 18 days of priapism.
	8B263EA6	There was another brutal murder in Hove Beach today. This time, however, police do not believe it is related to the ever-tightening hold of the Russian mafia on the area. The victim, a Mr. Tom Rivas, had told the owner of the 69th Street Diner that he was on a "hot date." He was then seen in a romantic context with an older, "foreign-looking" man. Moments later, he was dead. Mr. Rivas was unemployed but is reported to have had a number of older boyfriends who supported him. Police are currently pursuing all leads in the hope that one will lead them to the killer.
