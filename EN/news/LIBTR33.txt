	8FE3C69E	Deputy Police Commissioner, Francis McReary, witnessed his brother's murder as he was assassinated in an Algonquin park. Derrick McReary, 52, had recently returned to Liberty City from Ireland. Before he had left the country, he had been registered as an informant with the LCPD and investigators are taking this as a likely motive for the murder. In unrelated news, a third brother, Gerald McReary, was recently arrested on racketeering charges.

	7D43FB62	Today the Liberty Tree witnessed an emotional reunion between an Algonquin couple and their son who was lost for six years in a KRAPEA store. A well-known pedophile at Krapea's Alderney branch alerted staff to a pallid youth whom he had spotted sleeping in the same bunk-bed on his last three visits. The child's mother told reporters, "It's a miracle. We were sure that our son was dead and had even converted his bedroom into a home gym. He appears to be a little institutionalized and cannot understand why we don't have fifteen adjacent kitchens but it's great to have him back."
