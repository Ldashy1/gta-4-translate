Klietzel is charged with engaging in sexual relations with the clones, which range from 10 to 48 years of age. The 16-year-old Dr. Klietzel clone said, "We all love each other, all of us clones.

	63393B46	Terrorists have struck again! Police responded to reports of gunfire at the old oil refinery in the Acter Industrial Park in Alderney and found the bodies of several men. Most of the men were identified as known associates of the Pavano crime family along with Pete Marchetti and Marco Bonnaro, both from Alderney. A N.O.O.S.E spokeman said that they are treating this as an act of terrorism and do not see any significant organized crime link, "The Acter Industrial Park is full of sensitive equipment and volatile chemicals. The terrorists were probably scouting for a target when they ran into these mobsters, a gunfight ensued and the terrorists fled the scene. A mobster is a patriot just like every other American; they were doing a duty for their country." Witnesses saw several cars fleeing the scene. One of them carried an injured person in the backseat. One man clearly had a foreign accent.
