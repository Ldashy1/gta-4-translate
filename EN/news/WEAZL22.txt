	F05A5BC4	The Libertonian Museum has been closed for renovation for several months now, not that anyone would notice. This columnist, for one, wants it to stay that way. It is a liberal establishment aiming to infect anyone who visits it with godlessness. Anyone who sees the fossil exhibit will understand this - it completely fails to present the real side of the so-called dinosaur debate. At no point do they alert visitors to the possibility that these beasts were put there to test our faith.
