	80135976	Video games caused Dragonbrain massacre
	914A82E2	Congressional Liberals are working with activist group Citizens Understand Medieval Games Undermine Loving Parents to outlaw all video games after what is being called the Dragonbrain massacre. Police arrested Chris Ryan yesterday and charged him with the murder of a fellow moviegoer at a recent showing of the movie Dragonbrain. Police say they apprehended Ryan as he was deflowering a maiden in the privy. Ryan's lawyer argues his client lives like an elf and has no electricity.
	7C195880	A spokesperson for activist group Citizens Understand Medieval Games Undermine Loving Parents argued that video games are to blame for this crime because fantasy has melded into reality in the minds of these sickos just like in too many of the games they play. The spokesperson added that she is available for all media appearances and TV shows on the subject and is writing a book about how children should be raised.
