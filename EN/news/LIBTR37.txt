	E9CFF469	No more bending over backwards or having a rib removed to give yourself oral treats. Scientists have performed a successful experiment that will allow you to clone yourself. But the question on everyone's lips - is it ok for your clone to give you a hand job, or for you to engage in sodomy with your clone? Dr. Yahann Klietzel, a prominent reproductive scientist and geneticist says, "This is a breakthrough in science. Finally we are able to clone ourselves, so while your clone is going to work and making the money, you are able to stay at home and masturbate and play video games, just like women. And when your clone comes home, you can enjoy each other in any way you want. Truly, this is the future." Klietzel added, "Oh, yes, it is not gay."

N.O.O.S.E operatives have started to find high-quality counterfeit $100 bills in circulation in Liberty City. They are believed to be so-called supernotes - fake currency using identical ink and paper to genuine bills printed overseas. Police believe the current batch originates from Asia. N.O.O.S.E estimates that among $100 bills one in every fifty is counterfeit.
