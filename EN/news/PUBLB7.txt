	A1297C48	Great weed. Lumberjacks. A shitty military. Canada is beginning to look better every day for those of us who want to live a peaceful life composting our own shit, drinking fair trade coffee and preaching to everyone about the evils of plastic. With the passing of the US Jingoism Act, it is clear that many Americans are not welcome anymore. The founders of our country were noble men who, upon losing their teeth, did like George Washington and had new ones extracted from their slaves and implanted into their own. It's that kind of freedom that this country was founded on - freedom for some, tough luck for the rest. We're liberal, and it's our time to be on top next.
