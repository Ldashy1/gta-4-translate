	DFAF25F0	A group of young men are turning the streets of Liberty City into death traps. They meet in super-charged killing machines in order to race at insane speeds through city streets. In the world of illegal street racing, all that matters is the size of your stick, the smell of your leather, the garishness of your paintjob, and the sheen on your rims.

When asked if Mr. Kibbutz endorsed this reckless endangerment of Liberty City residents, he refused to continue the interview and became enraged, hitting the wall of his garage repeatedly with his head. Do we have to wait until a sight-impaired elderly woman is struck by a testosterone-pumped gearhead like Brucie Kibbutz before this dangerously irresponsible street racing is brought under control? We hope not, Mayor Ochoa.

At times the debate centered on hot lesbian action, but conservatives defeated riders and focused on man-on-man debate. Politicians went at it fiercely into the night, tired and sore from hours of passionate exchanges. Legislation on same-sex marriage is expected soon.

	74D680FC	As if Middle Park was not dangerous enough, a suspected gay basher is on the loose. Several gay men have been attacked over the past weeks. Deputy Mayor Bryce Dawkins believes that this spree of beatings is down to a lack of family values. "Homosexuality should not be flaunted around parks where impressionable young children or I might see."

Hate crimes have no place in our city, unlike financial fraud, insider trading, counterfeit goods, or political corruption." Suddenly, a walk in Middle Park doesn't sound like a good idea.
