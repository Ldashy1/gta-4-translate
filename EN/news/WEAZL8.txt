	874D4634	Link from gays to terrorists finally acknowledged.
	A03A0DA4	Deputy Mayor Stands Up for Family Values
	B59C37E3	Freedom from gays?
	0CFA8AA7	At least someone amongst the bunch of liberals, degenerates and immigrant lovers in Liberty City's governing team understands the problems our society faces. Deputy Mayor Dawkins made an intelligent and impassioned speech yesterday in which he stood up for family values and against the liberal monopoly on ideas. His ideas were simple - so simple a five year old could understand them - and that's the kind of idea that made this country great and that our enemies hate.

Our enemies don't hate us because we bomb them or protect vicious absolute monarchies in oil rich states - that's left wing poppy cock. Our enemies hate us because we tolerate degenerates. The sooner we all accept this, the sooner we can begin to win the war on terror, which is also a war on our families. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins.
