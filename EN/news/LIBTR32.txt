	CF2CD2B7	Today the Liberty Tree witnessed an emotional reunion between an Algonquin couple and their son who was lost for six years in a KRAPEA store. A well-known pedophile at Krapea's Alderney branch alerted staff to a pallid youth whom he had spotted sleeping in the same bunk-bed on his last three visits. The child's mother told reporters, "It's a miracle. We were sure that our son was dead and had even converted his bedroom into a home gym. He appears to be a little institutionalized and cannot understand why we don't have fifteen adjacent kitchens but it's great to have him back."
	C5DD6F4B	Today, the LCPD is hungry for blood. They're out to find a killer who took one of their own, Deputy Police Commissioner Francis McReary. McReary was gunned down in a small courtyard park in Algonquin. He was apparently killed with a high-caliber rifle shot from some distance. McReary's recent career has been mired in controversy. Some news outlets claim they have evidence of bribe-taking and corruption by Mr. McReary, claims he strongly denied until his death. In an unrelated incident his brother, Gerald McReary, a convicted felon, was recently arrested again on racketeering charges.
