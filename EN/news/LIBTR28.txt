	58D1F288	Now several employees are revealing that such doping products should also be banned from the board room. Interns have complained of 'roid rages' and terrifying outbreaks of acne. One former Eris employee told us, "Pete has become increasingly delusional and terrifyingly vain. As the drugs caused his testicles to shrink, he'd often use golf balls inside his cycling shorts so that he looked good in a spin class." We will stay with this story if it becomes interesting.
	690C92FD	Keep-fit fanatic and chief executive and founder of Eris Sportswear, Pete Vassal, has been checked into rehab after admitting a chronic addiction to steroids. Mr. Vassal, the man famed as having the best abs of anyone running a BAWSAQ company, attributed his fitness to a punishing exercise regime. Now it emerges that Mr. Vassal also was a serious 'juicer', consuming a wide variety of steroids and doping products, including the deadly bull shark testosterone, a form of the male hormone so strong it induces terrifying rages and mood swings in all who take it. Mr. Vassal had only recently spoken out against performance-enhancing drugs in sport.

Great. We at the Liberty Tree cannot wait for the big haired invasion.
