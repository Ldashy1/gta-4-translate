	AADD48F2	~z~It was great - you got to see people turn into animals and your close friends die.
	A98EFD53	~z~My mother - my mother is one of life's victims.
	A89F82A6	~z~I found her. Roman does not know - he thought she died in a house fire.
	AD0BCE7B	~z~I couldn't date you... someone like my brothers. I couldn't do that to myself.
	AFE4EC7D	~z~You don't have to thank me, Kate. Needed what?
	AD9D8570	~z~She wanted to send me too, but I wanted to fight. I was stupid.
	AD2D0E70	GCK2_THERAPY_GR
	A248BC27	~z~So me what?
	A205A1E4	~z~Do you think that that is where he is?

	A3AE88F7	~z~I think we all need new beginnings.
	A77602B1	GCK2_STUPID_FG
	A5B0BE99	~z~I am what I am, for better or worse.
	A4BAAD1A	~z~Rather than me keeping secrets about my family from you, you're probably keeping secrets about my family from me?
	B75ABFF7	GCK2_TOUGH_BJ
	B54D2C34	~z~Maybe it's a break from it all... a new beginning.
	B4F8D333	GCK2_FAMILY_EK
	B8BDCF54	~z~None of the boys liked my dad, and he didn't appear to like them much either. He believed in discipline, you know?
	BE506045	~z~Try to keep those two sides of my life separate.
	BC4C22CD	~z~When the war came, she saved up all her money and sent Roman here.
	BB396AD6	~z~Alright then, this isn't a date. We're just two people, hanging out.
	B1CF5877	GCK2_STUPID_FP
	B12772F2	GCK2_PREACH_DD
	B08AC4BA	~z~You poor bastard, you have. I don't normally socialize with people that know my family.
	B27C9CCE	~z~Don't mention it.

	8C372522	~z~With a family like yours, I would have thought you would have learnt to cope by now.
	8D02919B	~z~So, you.
	8FC67D66	~z~I hope so, I don't want to believe that every man in my family was as bad as my brothers.
	8E4D8040	~z~I guess it's nice be honest for a change.
	8E2B196D	~z~Well, is a good thing that we are just friends. If this was a date, I'd be scared.
	88D4093A	~z~Probably.
	884D263D	~z~It's nice to have a friend, Niko. I feel like you are someone I can speak to.
	86D2BF0D	~z~Maybe you're right.

	9FAEF987	GCK2_TOUGH_BF
	9DF14896	~z~Some downtime. A moment away from the craziness of it all - my family, life in general.
	92A4D5DD	GCK2_PREACH_DH
	9219020B	~z~You know, just waiting around and wasting time until she can join my father in the eternal splendor of Heaven.

	99330FD4	GCK2_TOUGH_BO
	98A7A9BF	~z~You seem well, Niko.
	94805A68	~z~The world is hard. What are you going to do?
	BEE0AF28	~z~she was... she was... she was raped and murdered.
	E4B4FD9B	GCK2_FAMILY_EN
	E4704071	~z~Another what?
	E3C063CE	GCK2_HIGHWAYMAN_CH
	E5A73F99	GCK2_NICE_AA
	E8311B05	GCK2_NICE_AH
	E70E5ACF	~z~but it's those moments when you can just forget that I value most.
	E6EA0220	GCK2_TOUGH_BI
	DE3DB2F3	GCK2_THERAPY_GP
	DE102F57	~z~Sorry. I knew it was a dumb question. It's just, I hoped it wasn't so awful for you.
	DC0E1BC8	~z~Is nice to get to know you too, seems like I've gotten pretty close to everyone else in your family.
	DFE0E9F6	~z~You're still stupid!
	E37BB634	GCK2_NICE_AK
	E2D48742	~z~I wasn't suggesting that, Niko. I was just saying that therapy is one of the reasons I'm still here today.
	E1AFC079	~z~You know what my family is like.
	F91DFEEE	~z~I'm sure you do, Niko. Maybe it's something other than forgetting that you need though.
	F7EE6034	GCK2_THERAPY_GI
	F7D919DE	~z~Ha ha.
	FB276DDF	~z~Another one like my brothers. A tough guy with a death wish. A man eager to get into Hell as soon as possible.
	FEEBF56C	~z~So what?
	FED07278	GCK2_THERAPY_GM
	FD473266	~z~Maybe.
	EBA049C9	GCK2_FAMILY_EC
	EAE933B2	~z~They hated him, they'd fight with him and scream at him and run away for days at a time before he'd drag them home.

	CD2B4BBD	~z~My aunt, Roman's mother,
	CF047771	GCK2_STUPID_FI
	CDCC8E0E	~z~Sorry, Niko. Talk about armchair psychology. I'm boring you.
	CD41B019	GCK2_HIGHWAYMAN_CB
	C2333C3B	~z~To live a normal life, I mean - get married, have kids, not steal, rob, kill.
	C06C7269	GCK2_THERAPY_GL
	C02941EC	~z~It taught me how to get by, how to detach myself from people who upset me. Therapy works... it sort of works.
	C2B29218	~z~Actually, I wish to forget some of the things that happened to me here, in Liberty City as well.
	C68CA368	GCK2_PREACH_DR
	C492E6FE	~z~How is your Mother?
	C2EBC241	GCK2_FAMILY_EO
	D86BE3B6	GCK2_PREACH_DF
	D6A9A4E4	~z~So, are you another one?
	D600E641	GCK2_NICE_AE
	D8B5A3E0	~z~Not at all, friend. Families are strange things.
	DB87E876	~z~No. It was seeing your home destroyed, seeing members of your family die.
	DB1E941D	~z~What did your brothers think?
	D8CD492D	GCK2_PREACH_DS
	D13B8338	GCK2_TOUGH_BR
	D11B4C6B	~z~I know - look at the company I keep.
	D0CCF0AE	GCK2_TOUGH_BB
	D1FCE593	~z~I was in therapy for a long time, Niko. It helped me a lot.
	D4DB618B	~z~It can't be easier, than having a job I mean?
	D3A8C5E7	GCK2_HIGHWAYMAN_CJ
	D3931F95	~z~Yes. Our fathers were brothers.

	2E4A5502	~z~Same as always - trying to deal with the reality of my awful family.
	27389019	~z~Everyone needs a way to cope with his or her pain.
	2640A978	GCK2_STUPID_FL
	204C3DB1	~z~It's nice to have a friend who understands the madness that I've lived through.

	3FE696A1	GCK2_HIGHWAYMAN_CE
	3F572C9A	GCK2_FAMILY_EP
	3CE1F231	~z~Tell me about your family. Roman - he's your cousin...
	4061E472	~z~This is nice, isn't it?
	42B5121B	~z~Thanks, Niko. I needed this.
	42834D66	GCK2_THERAPY_GC
	408FB8F2	~z~Why don't you want to live?
	3728A6F8	GCK2_STUPID_FR
	3007B60A	GCK2_TOUGH_BD
	2FCA9768	~z~What's wrong with me? Quite a lot, I'm sure.
	372BA722	GCK2_TOUGH_BE
	3C8B2341	~z~I was mostly raised by Roman's mother. She was great. An amazing person.
	3C7EF616	~z~I do, but I don't think that any life is not mad. You were here in America.
	3C62D8A0	GCK2_STUPID_FO
	0AAA8DC3	~z~Ha ha - I know all about that.
	0A9B886D	~z~Lord above - you don't even enjoy it? Then why do it?
	0A78A1A7	~z~I too have things I wish to forget. The things that happened to me back home, the war...
	0C7EDA96	~z~I do not need some quack trying to get inside my head.
	0D9112B6	~z~How annoying. What is wrong with you people? You men.
	0D73FE93	~z~I don't know... getting out, doing stuff, not working or fighting with my family. Getting to know you.
	0D64F8A9	~z~My dad was a drinker and he sure had a temper, but I believe in my heart of hearts that he was a good man.

	188B2984	~z~Thank you. How are you?
	1818ED78	GCK2_NICE_AD
	1955A5E1	~z~Not really.
	1D637C5F	~z~I just hope that the way you choose to deal with yours is productive, not destructive.
	1A3B756E	GCK2_TOUGH_BH
	1975A74D	~z~Me too.
	0EA300F5	~z~What's nice?
	0E2B9970	~z~You have had opportunities that most of the world could not imagine.
	0DC8342E	GCK2_PREACH_DP
	1004D7E1	~z~Well, for a murdering, thieving idiot who can't talk about things, you're kind of nice.
	154A0963	GCK2_STUPID_FN
	128C82F0	GCK2_STUPID_FM
	125F829A	~z~What was different about you and him?
	4326FAAF	~z~That's it. But it's nice. I'm enjoying myself.
	737BDA2C	~z~Can you do me a favor, and stop preaching? I'm fine.
	717FD572	~z~I was his princess, I was the little girl. And I didn't give him a reason to discipline me.
	71159393	~z~The war taught me a lot of bad things, but it also taught me to enjoy life.
	73ED6047	~z~They were identical. But did they get along? No. they hated each other. They were both assholes, you see.
	7733A63D	~z~Sounds like you still are.
	76A4B368	GCK2_THERAPY_GE
	7549E7AB	~z~You should see him around me, if a man even looks in my direction, he threatens to rip his heart out.
	66B4053E	~z~I don't know. I have lived a complicated life. I was in a war.
	662FC4CC	~z~We grew up the next house to each other. So physically yes. And temperamentally, yes.
	63764404	~z~I don't know if I'd agree that Packie was a moralist. He seems like a highwayman through and through.

	7D689B49	GCK2_PREACH_DL
	7C44EAFC	~z~I guess I played up to it even more because my relationship with him was something I had that the boys didn't.
	7C2C1450	GCK2_PREACH_DO
	7F817695	~z~So.

	816CF60E	~z~Forgive me... I'm sorry if this is a weird question - what was the war like?
	793316D0	GCK2_FAMILY_EG
	78B6B107	GCK2_TOUGH_BG
	77C719C4	~z~They were wife beating alcoholics, who, luckily, were both what they deserved to be.
	795B0D8E	GCK2_PREACH_DN
	7C04F140	GCK2_FAMILY_EE
	7A6C818D	~z~My whole life has been learning to cope. I sort of can,
	7973568C	~z~No comment.
	4C274D65	GCK2_STUPID_FF
	4B4E4801	~z~I like that.
	4A528C03	GCK2_THERAPY_GO
	4DF20E57	~z~Dad drove my brothers mad. I sometimes think that the reason they act the way they do is rebelling against him.

	47218B5B	~z~An Irish family manages to make it the eighteenth century when or wherever they are.
	49B587CC	~z~You don't normally take the guys you date back to meet the family?

	48A14BDC	GCK2_NICE_AF
	5C3FEEDF	GCK2_THERAPY_GG
	5C07AC70	~z~Date? This isn't a date, Niko. We're just getting to know each other. We might be friends and that's all.
	58CC2EB0	~z~The men in my family are just highwaymen and moralists, usually both in equal measure.

	5FEBB30C	~z~What have you been up to? Actually, I don't think I want to know. I'm sure it made you feel big and strong.
	53A89FBE	~z~Were they close?
	50EF7422	GCK2_TOUGH_BN
	5033139B	~z~Fair enough. A life time of trying to sort my brothers out has left me a little sanctimonious.
