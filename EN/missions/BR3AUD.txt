BR3_CUT1_14	5552CD68	~z~Fuck you.
BR3_CUT1_15	1A365730	~z~No. Dude, listen!
BR3_CUT1_16	487933B5	~z~The cousin of that guy you killed, Lyle Rivas, owes me a lot of money.
BR3_CUT1_17	148ECBE5	~z~And the dick won't pay. Instead he's said he's going to have me killed, that bitch.
BR3_CUT1_18	42BCA840	~z~Hi-ah!
BR3_CUT1_19	07E83298	~z~Brucie, you got to chill. For real.
BR3_CUT1_2	A6B0658F	~z~Hey, guys.
BR3_CUT1_20	0B2E3B9C	~z~Yeah, yeah, yeah...
BR3_CUT1_21	15FC5138	~z~Now listen, NB, this guy is in hiding.
BR3_CUT1_22	2803F547	~z~But - he's a serious co...
BR3_CUT1_23	E071E61C	~z~He's a serious cockhound.
BR3_CUT1_24	B2BE8AB6	~z~Oh. So you think of me.
BR3_CUT1_25	8CFFBF39	~z~No! But the guy knows me, and I don't think anyone would date that fat Slav.
BR3_CUT1_26	CF2A438D	~z~So, I'm just doing your profile.
BR3_CUT1_27	382B151D	~z~Alright, let me see...
BR3_CUT1_28	4617B0F6	~z~I am a "vulnerable guy who needs to be held by big strong arms"?
BR3_CUT1_29	5BCDDC62	~z~Yeah.
BR3_CUT1_3	9770C710	~z~Fifty-nine... sixty...
BR3_CUT1_30	51D2C9B4	~z~You got to be kidding me!
BR3_CUT1_31	6266EADC	~z~I knew we should have made him a giver not a taker, Brucie!
BR3_CUT1_32	F0D407B8	~z~Oh, shut up! Now listen, Nicky... I need you.
BR3_CUT1_33	77799511	~z~And I will pay heavily for this.
BR3_CUT1_34	E93C7895	~z~Okay.
BR3_CUT1_35	93174C4C	~z~And Roman, cousin?
BR3_CUT1_36	86EE33FA	~z~You're a dick.
BR3_CUT1_37	30940747	~z~Ahh! Nicky!

BR3_CUT1_7	5E9F556E	~z~Hit me, come on!
BR3_CUT1_8	4CD5B1DB	~z~Ohh, motherfuckers....
BR3_CUT1_9	C6862536	~z~Niko, you wanna go on a date?
