	AF808F90	~z~You know, cousin, things have been looking up since you got here.
	AAE4BB5E	~z~Yeah, thank you for arranging that, Roman. Will I have to pay for the next one?
	AA902BBF	~z~I'm working on it, cousin. There's this girl I like - she's called Kate McReary.
	B198A79D	100010100100100010100
	B0366B2C	~z~Please tell me you are talking about twins and bleached blond hair and D-cup titties.
	AFB80039	~z~Kate's death was very unfortunate. Niko, don't blame yourself.
	A93E7A46	~z~I don't know, this and that. I've been hanging out with Little Jacob.
	A809B1E2	MF3_B_SJ

	BBB4F32C	MF3_B_XF
	BBB2D542	~z~Niko, I just found the best site ever. It's called craplist.net and you can get anything on there.
	C3286BED	~z~Well, you know what they say, nothing in this country is free. I'm joking.
	C2CE8E8B	MF3_C_AC
	C0A0D26A	100100010100100
	BB7F01BD	~z~Yes it is, Roman. You're right.
	B62742E1	~z~Since the moment I met Mallorie, I knew that she was the only woman for me.

	B4E688E0	MF3_C_AJ
	BB4AEA14	MF3_C_BA
	B8C8A220	~z~I can't tell what he is saying most of the time, but I like him.
	B8645665	~z~Whatever is mine is yours as long as you are hanging out with me.
	A21864FA	~z~There's no one else to blame, Roman. It's my fault, because I refused to do that deal for Pegorino.
	91C91DB0	100010100100
	91911DA9	MF3_B_XA
	90F6E062	~z~Speak to you soon.
	951634EC	~z~You're a wild man, NB.
	9244C553	~z~Yeah, I'm fine. How's married life?
	91EF897C	~z~I wouldn't abuse our friendship like that, Roman. Don't worry.
	8B07A5BE	MF3_B_SK
	85A9B31D	~z~Roman?
	8569162D	~z~an Irish hood called Packie, an African American drug dealer who calls himself Playboy X,
	8548E997	MF3_B_WB
	89FEF99B	~z~I know you wouldn't, Niko. Let's hang out soon.
	8948BB2B	100100010100100100010100010010100
	8606D6A1	~z~I had to choose who'd win the argument and I chose the young guy - Playboy X is his name.
	9EAAA2F2	~z~I don't want you running off to the other side of Liberty City and only calling me to ask for cabs.
	9D5CDF0F	MF3_B_UI
	9D3BEB07	~z~If things are looking up now, I hate to think what they were like before I arrived.
	A165A340	MF3_B_WA
	A144991C	~z~No, certainly not. They were just distractions from my one true love.
	A0736C8B	MF3_B_TC
	9CA524F1	MF3_B_SG
	97310C3F	~z~Well, I've only checked women and you can get them on there.

	EA961B36	MF3_B_PE
	EA7A3A0A	MF3_B_SB
	EF861EBD	~z~I didn't think she'd be a cop.
	ED3CE538	~z~That's my cousin, Niko.
	ECBD192F	~z~Shit, Niko, I'm sorry for putting the two of you together.
	E94E9D2F	~z~Spend the money on a clean hotel room and a dirty college girl.
	E2D55069	~z~I'm afraid I haven't met these women of your dreams, Roman.
	E048CBEF	~z~some outlaw biker guy named Johnny, and a doctor who buys dead bodies so he can sell the organs.
	DFF4F078	~z~Sure I will, Roman. Later on.

	E7C05E56	MF3_C_AH
	E4BAB646	MF3_B_YF
	F8DF3031	~z~I am talking serious money, Niko. This is not the sort of cash you carry around in your track pants.
	F7773980	~z~Call me if you want to hang out afterwards, cousin.
	F68D0976	MF3_B_QA
	FD3FBA30	~z~She was always saying she wanted to meet a mysterious man from the East. I thought she was kinky,
	FD2B7108	MF3_C_BF
	FCC6DF29	~z~Hey man, I heard you got a ride in one of my cabs.
	F6260713	~z~Those other times I hid, I was right to be nervous, wasn't I?
	F23E94FF	~z~That is your bad English, Niko. Once you have been in America for longer you will understand him perfectly.

	CD853BD3	~z~You should, Niko. Stay close to Mallorie and me. We're your family.
	D0B22C23	~z~So, what's happening in your world at the moment? Met anybody interesting recently?
	D04F773D	~z~I'll invite her to the wedding.
	CEE3B88F	~z~Niko, Niko, I think I'm being followed. I swear it.
	CCF4A547	~z~Sounds like you are having a crazy time. Talk to you soon.
	C9F771CB	~z~It's like a dating site only these girls are really up for it. You know? Later on, NB.

	CA1F21F4	MF3_C_AG
	DB4E5765	~z~It's my fault because I got close to her. I shouldn't get close to anyone.
	DB0CC7F1	MF3_C_AM
	DA3CBE0A	MF3_B_UA
	DD65793E	~z~Niko, this is important. Do you know anyone who can lend me money?
	DC7EB5F7	MF3_B_XG
	DC042C76	MF3_C_BD
	D9D6F35F	~z~That makes two of us. Later on, Roman.

	245FE386	~z~Do you want me to come pick you up?
	21D3835B	~z~I couldn't understand completely, something about Babylon. That guy is crazy.
	20D1DC6A	~z~Roman, why're you whispering? Are you hiding in a trash can again or the trunk of a car.
	20A80BE1	~z~Not really, I got caught up in an argument between a drug dealer and his drug dealing mentor.
	23B53ECF	MF3_B_XB
	22EF86DE	~z~Right about Brucie. He's more than just a steroid fuelled maniac, he's a good guy.
	22473519	~z~Okay, alright. We should hang out more. Call me if you ever want to do anything fun.
	3A4EEE00	MF3_B_RD
	3A386030	MF3_B_YG
	3898FC8E	~z~If you're losing money at the tables you might be able to sell some body parts to him for a quick buck.
	3B691E9D	~z~You two are friends now? This is great. I thought you'd get along.
	3B13D900	~z~Congratulations on the engagement.

	2BBA8943	MF3_B_TA
	3580AAB5	~z~NB, Jacob told me some weird shit went down with Michelle.
	31304535	MF3_B_SA
	309B2235	~z~Right about what?
	206A4B56	~z~Other than the community leader and drug dealer that Mallorie introduced me to...
	0B1FD4B2	~z~Roman, have you been gambling? I will give you any money you need.
	0A2F0EA1	MF3_B_RC
	09C497CE	MF3_B_ZC
	11B74432	~z~Congratulations, Roman. You'll make a good father. See you soon.
	10849194	~z~That's probably because you are always either working or being hassled by loansharks.
	0BF9A250	MF3_C_AD
	089A81C4	~z~Niko, I feel like when we are hanging out it always has to be about something.
	04522968	~z~Mallorie is pregnant. If it's a girl, we'll call it Kate.
	03D6930A	~z~How much does a kidney go for nowadays? I'm kidding, NB, kidding.
	027C44AD	~z~Michelle is some kind of cop or informant or something, I don't know. What the fuck, man?
	088D2BE1	~z~This time is different because I haven't pissed anyone off.
	082E008C	MF3_B_YC
	0758CFB1	~z~Niko, my cousin. Tell me I was right.
	1C4B5176	MF3_B_QD

	13F4E79E	~z~No, I'm fucking crazy for trusting anyone.
	136DFD79	~z~Apart from those other ones you screw, right?
	15558148	~z~You don't even know her, Roman so please try not to embarrass me.
	150BBB38	MF3_C_AF
	14F02199	MF3_C_BE
	3D0D6AA5	~z~Like getting drunk or shooting pool. Later on, NB.
	69C91490	~z~Okay, that's cool. Later on, NB.
	68636F07	MF3_B_PA
	67455947	~z~No, I was referring to a Deputy Police Commissioner called Francis McReary,
	6CFDB09B	~z~Now all we need to do is find you a wife and we can all settle down happily ever after.
	6CE3DA9C	MF3_B_PC
	69DA3694	~z~Thank you, cousin.
	634308B2	~z~Where are you, cousin? I'm waiting near Perestroika. Get here soon, okay?
	60AB6921	~z~No, it's because you both get along with me. You're more than just a violent criminal to me, cousin.
	6008FD8E	010100010100010100010
	5F87C104	MF3_B_PD

	7792B023	~z~The 'roid rage has screwed up his head so I think I'll just be hangin' with him. No more work.
	745CEE2A	MF3_B_PG
	722514DA	~z~Roman, how's it going?
	5F81A526	010100010100010100100
	4C6C6369	~z~So he's treating you like a rich asshole. Who cares? Enjoy yourself.
	445332EC	MF3_B_TB
	436C8131	MF3_C_BH
	4F6A469F	~z~Is that because we're both violent criminals, cousin?
	4E445D87	~z~Maybe you were right about him being fun to hang with but he's crazy.
	4D293E67	MF3_B_OD
	432B2953	MF3_B_OC
