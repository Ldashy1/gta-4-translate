	AF7AA93A	~z~The Pegorinos? They're not a family.

	A9043F30	~z~Don't worry about it. You've got enough on your plate looking after Roman. See you soon.
	A85EED27	~z~I've already helped you but I'll help you again. Wait for me to be in touch.
	A6D82D38	~z~What's up, Mallorie?

	AAAD9B1C	MF2_XH
	AA70A9A9	~z~Do you know where Vlad is?
	B810BD4A	~z~Elizabeta Torres, she's got an apartment on San Quentin in Fortside. Meet me there.
	B558FB76	~z~Is your johnson so big you can't keep it in your pants, Bellic? I told you to be calm.
	B4B8D577	MF2_A_BJ
	B9CA5318	~z~Yeah, thanks for helping him get rid of the body. He has such fire in his heart.

	B490C8A9	~z~Thanks and hey, Roman and I decided to be honest with each other last night. He told me about Vlad.
	B3DC49DB	~z~Mallorie, the man who got Roman killed is dead.
	B33F90C4	~z~What do you want, to make me do more "good things for your cause"?
	A588C45B	MF2_OB
	911701B6	~z~Roman hasn't spoken to you about anything, has he? Nothing about maybe asking me to marry him?
	8C2434B2	~z~I know it gets lonely. I know what it feels like to get close to a man.
	8B5A7FB1	~z~Come on, Mallorie. Roman wouldn't do something like that to the love of his life.
	95197A32	~z~Hey, this Mallorie. Leave me a message and I'll hit you back.

	8AACE283	~z~I was tired of him as soon as I saw him.
	88DABA9B	MF2_A_CB
	83A52D24	MF2_JC
	A2E66357	~z~You know Roman, he has these other women but you're the only one he loves.
	A243EEC9	~z~You have nothing left. Goodbye and good luck.
	9F8F61CC	~z~I been taking a lot of heat for you, Niko. Start doing me some favors.

	E905FC50	~z~Now, you're useless to me. We need someone who wants something, someone with burning desires.
	F12841D3	~z~I guess when he found out about me and Vlad he couldn't help himself.
	F107070D	~z~I looked at him and realized that revenge was not what I wanted after all.
	F0DB9557	MF2_YD
	E3836DD3	MF2_JD
	E2A19A0A	~z~Now these Russian putas keep calling me asking where he is, like I fucking know.
	E1980D7C	~z~Bellic, I want to introduce you to John Gravelli, head of the Gambetti family. He needs help.
	E9047671	MF2_YC
	E4F32C08	~z~That won't bring him back will it? He'll never even meet his son.
	E3C131B9	~z~Hey, sometimes I just can't help myself.

	FBE9DC6D	MF2_HC
	FB9A4D91	~z~Hey Niko, you tired of Manny yet?
	FF58A3B0	~z~After all that trouble, you didn't even kill him. Remarkable.
	FD980E56	~z~Niko, I heard that Michelle was a cop or a fed or something, is it true?
	FC95DB4D	~z~Your child will never worry about anything, Mallorie.

	F8264513	~z~Listen, I'll level with you - I stupidly got involved with him to get back at Roman, for all his playing around.

	BC769B9A	~z~I'll start doing that when you start doing me some.
	BBF24599	100100100
	BFAA541C	~z~Roman and I are getting on well now, and I don't want this shit to jeopardize anything. Thanks Niko.
	BF995FC2	MF2_A_DD
	BF45C9C1	~z~Niko, I heard that Michelle was a cop or a fed or something, is it true?
	CF897E96	~z~He did?
	CCBBE4AD	~z~I don't know what she is, but she was lying to us all along and now I'm paying for it.
	CC2CF7E1	~z~I haven't heard anything, but I'm sure it would be a really good thing for both of you.
	DDB61AEF	~z~His love for me took over and he just had to kill him.
	D8A9447D	~z~Putanesca. There was always something funky about her. I'm real sorry.
	D81A1256	~z~Son?

	27AABC7B	~z~Good thing you haven't been hanging around with them too much. That shit is fucked up. I'm sorry for getting you involved.
	2687F348	MF2_A_BC
	3BC713FD	~z~You think I wouldn't have fingered him in a second if he was your guy?
	3A5DB93E	SFX_MACHINE_BEEP
	39F3FE37	MF2_LC
	421B6234	~z~No more jobs, is that it? Am I out?
	3F319ACE	~z~I'm helping you find the man you're after, I'm not some reunite old boyfriends service. Look, I was in the army.
	3D53D22B	MF2_A_JA
	322DCE8D	~z~I thought I told you to lay low? To keep your head down?
	31957441	100010100
	2EEABFF6	~z~Thank you, Niko. I know you're trying, but a child without a father has a lot to worry about. Trust me on that one.
	369B9712	MF2_A_CC
	344DC699	~z~You're out. You've done good things for us and we are grateful. That said, I've given you a lot of protection.
	342F7929	~z~I'm sorry, I'm excitable.
	1F415AF2	~z~So, I hear you've found the big bad monster you were after? Bernie Crane, the muscle Mary. Come on.
	09E5EEF3	~z~Hey, you've reached the phone of the future Mrs. Bellic. Leave me or Roman a message and we'll get back to you.
	0987F531	~z~I'm pregnant, we were going to say something at the reception.
	0536D218	MF2_ZA
	0C019D12	~z~Puto, where are the scissors? Where are the fucking scissors?
	0BE6E215	~z~Tell him you were sent by a mutual friend. He's expecting you.
	0B5AA9DB	~z~I don't know what she is, but she was lying to us all along and now I'm paying for it.
	0327A141	MF2_NA
	0220CE89	~z~Gravelli is the only man who can get what you need done. He's in Schottler Medical center.

	041E9897	100100
	15E018E6	~z~Really?
	15137EED	~z~Give him some of his own medicine - find out if he was serious about me.
	13290450	~z~Bellic, I have your man. He's been flown in. We're going to drop him in the airport cargo area for you.
	1CD43200	~z~Niko, tell me straight. Was Roman with another woman last night? I swear I'm going to cut his balls off.
	19BA0570	MF2_A_DF
	15FD529A	MF2_YA
	0FD7E9FB	~z~I'm already working for a Mafia family. They are scum.
	0E47A19E	~z~He don't act like it. Piece of shit, when I get my hands on him I'm going to...

	1176C272	MF2_A_BE
	43DB74DC	~z~Niko. The shit went down with those guys in Bohan. Elizabeta's doing a bid. I think she might have killed Manny.
	6B91BA9F	MF2_HB
	69DDF8B9	~z~For him, death would have been a release. For me, another stain I do not need.
	670445FA	MF2_XB
	6CEC2766	MF2_XG
	6C9D09C2	~z~I must be getting paranoid. Of course Roman wouldn't. Thanks Niko.
	6C698319	~z~So, you got your revenge. I hope it gave you the satisfaction you were looking for.

	65D441F6	MF2_XC
	65171EF3	~z~I haven't seen him.
	79E240EE	~z~I've got someone else who might have some work for you.
	73D824EE	MF2_MC
	72E9BA98	~z~He could be dead in the river for all I care. I just want to put that shit behind me -
	7DE83DB4	100100100
	7CBF9D0E	~z~That's exactly right, he's an old school romantic. See you soon, Mal.
	7B5E314A	MF2_MA
	71077E79	~z~You could have told me he was here.
	6FB93EF3	~z~Hey Niko.
	6D5FF72E	~z~Fuck you.

	5BD3E500	~z~Please leave a message.
	5B935C24	~z~Maybe you have learned something, Bellic. Goodbye and good luck. Try to live a good life.
	5ADF5229	~z~I'm sure you do, but you said you'd help me.
