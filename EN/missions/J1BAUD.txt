	98A7D3F3	~z~Fucking Liberty City families. Get 'em, Niko.
	99595079	~z~Tell me about it. But I don't give a shit about them other people.
	9741ED46	~z~We just hoping they got the manners to smile to our faces before they do it.
	985134B4	J1_QG
	9E22DC38	~z~Shit, but times is changed. Since RICO, the Commission ain't the same.
	A0C5D2E0	J1_KI
	A17779C9	~z~Is that it?
	A0060344	J1_EF
	A09ECC9B	~z~Either because they know too much and might rat.
	8FFDBDC2	~z~Guy who owned the diamonds, Gay Tony, is in with the Ancelottis.

	B28BD633	J1_EAC
	AFCD962F	~z~He's the one who's been keeping Ray from drowning in a pile of shit.
	AFD17F95	~z~They need a family with a new approach to be sitting down with 'em.
	A5B10143	J1_EO
	A77F6CC5	~z~What I'm worried about is our involvement with getting back to Gay Tony and his connections...
	A3F2D2F3	~z~Has to be. I only start paying attention to my crew when they start putting me in an awkward position.
	A4AA5ADD	J1_DL
	A78496B9	~z~You're covering me for six moves ahead
	AA64E027	~z~Or because they got too much power and they're too smart to get themselves clipped.

	7A981523	~z~They can't give me a seat but they can help me get one.
	6D67214B	~z~No wonder I ain't on the Commission when my muscle is this stupid!
	6D886267	J1_LB

	88839B31	~z~It don't do too well for the reputation of us Pegorinos having St Patrick that high up in our organization.
	892974F4	J1_QX
	7E1D2BD4	~z~This is a declaration of war. The Pegorinos and the Pavanos are hitting the mattresses.
	7E1DB316	~z~I guess not. Lucky I have people like you to teach me when I'm wrong.
	7CB504C8	~z~Only, how much can I do with a guy who ain't a full Italian?
	7E16023B	J1_EAD
	7FADE545	~z~My wife, Angie's, gonna love this. She keeps busting my balls about trying to get on the Commission.

	E5DCD70A	J1_QA
	E9205849	~z~Let's make 'em wish they was never born.
	E51E80DC	~z~I'm surprised you can even speak when your lips are always puckered up, kissing my ass.
	E5855B5B	J1_LH
	DB51BCAC	~z~They didn't come to your home while you and your wife were sleeping.
	DD85F9CD	~z~You giving them a nice little offering though, skip.
	D9E7FB7F	~z~Anyways, that's why Ray ain't ever gonna make it to the level he wants to reach.
	DA2DF17E	~z~They better not think of crossing that West River and not looking over their shoulders.
	DEA4E0AB	~z~and run all of Liberty City, the whole country maybe!
	E08DB5A3	100100100010100100100010010010100100100100010100010100

	EB15906C	J1_RD
	EC448F62	~z~Of course I wouldn't let some guy ball the mother of my children.
	E9345DC5	~z~Only way you know is by finding their shit all over the place in the morning.
	E93A8F97	~z~I can't believe them Pavanos would treat me like this. The Pegorino name should mean something to them.
	ECA1A0F2	~z~Can you do me a favor? Can you just shoot yourself to save me the trouble of doing it?
	F0EF285D	~z~Check to make sure my ass is covered in each situation.

	BF78C069	J1_LI
	C19FA331	~z~I got a nice little offering to the Pavanos that's gonna persuade 'em to argue my case.
	B76B7904	~z~He's 90% Irish.
	B9E068C3	J1_DV
	B64D730C	J1_LA
	B6E21D5D	~z~Whatever happened to the honored society and all that shit?

	D62AF2D5	~z~They also control a few bookies.
	D632CFC7	~z~Sit down next to Jon Gravelli, if he survives that long,
	D35E495F	~z~Well at least they had the respect to do it at a meet.
	D3CDCBA5	J1_DAG
	C6EE5458	~z~Pavanos work a little shy business on this side of the West River.
	C6FBECEF	J1_KB
	C5BFB535	J1_DAI_QQQ1
	C6E1B066	~z~then maybe the other families will give me their seat on the Commission.
	C744BE22	~z~Alright, let's get these slimeball bastards. People like that give Italians a bad name.
	CBF5ACC9	J1_DI
	CC195FE2	~z~He's too busy thinking about himself.

J1_CUT1_15	24FAAB37	~z~So... were you followed?
J1_CUT1_16	49DAF4F7	~z~I don't think so.
J1_CUT1_17	57989072	~z~Oh...
J1_CUT1_18	683C31B9	~z~I mean, who knows.
J1_CUT1_19	7DC65CCD	~z~Exactly... I mean, we can pretty much guarantee you were followed.
J1_CUT1_2	6547FFCD	~z~I'm here to see Mr. Pegorino...
J1_CUT1_20	052DEF5A	~z~The question is "did you know about it?".
J1_CUT1_21	D3390B71	~z~And right now, I don't know the answer to that question.
J1_CUT1_22	E0F726ED	~z~But to be honest, I don't really care neither.
J1_CUT1_23	2E9E423A	~z~I know enough about you, your cousin, your friends...
J1_CUT1_24	3E84E207	~z~I know a lot of people around you end up in jail.
J1_CUT1_25	1A349967	~z~Some maybe.
J1_CUT1_26	27FEB4FB	~z~But that's the same all over town. This is a dying game.
J1_CUT1_27	75A7D04C	~z~I don't understand.
J1_CUT1_28	25382F6A	~z~I mean I'm going to ask you to deal with a problem,
J1_CUT1_29	732C4B51	~z~and you're going to deal with it,
J1_CUT1_3	53E15D00	~z~Well, I didn't think you were here to sell me insurance.
J1_CUT1_30	1A311848	~z~or you're not going to deal with it, and you're going to be a problem that somebody else has to deal with.
J1_CUT1_31	2C5FBCA5	~z~But me? I ain't doing nothing.
J1_CUT1_32	35F0CFC7	~z~Yes, okay. So what's the problem?
J1_CUT1_33	47C9F379	~z~We'll get to that.
J1_CUT1_34	518386EC	~z~Anthony!
J1_CUT1_35	6345AA70	~z~Yo!
J1_CUT1_36	AC90BD0D	~z~Did Phil call?
J1_CUT1_37	7E55608F	~z~Not yet, boss. Ray called.
J1_CUT1_38	E4DF2DAD	~z~Of course he did.
J1_CUT1_39	B61DD02B	~z~I wonder... is it better to have a talented snake,
J1_CUT1_4	00D3B6E2	~z~So you here to work for him, shoot him, or arrest him? Or maybe all three?
J1_CUT1_40	2340AD93	~z~or a stoical lion, who's gonna be cut down in his prime?
J1_CUT1_41	31294964	~z~I don't know. What do you think?
J1_CUT1_42	77C6D69E	~z~I don't understand what you're talking about.
J1_CUT1_43	857A7205	~z~You do, but I ain't going to push.
J1_CUT1_44	702EC76A	~z~Anthony, get in here!
J1_CUT1_45	7E6463D5	~z~Boss?
J1_CUT1_46	53B20E71	~z~Where's Big Pete and Marco?
J1_CUT1_47	61A2AA52	~z~On their way.
J1_CUT1_48	A57231F8	~z~Listen to me... here's what the plan is.
J1_CUT1_49	C2C26C98	~z~Me and two of my guys gonna meet with a couple of boys from the Pavano family.
J1_CUT1_5	EFBA14AF	~z~Its okay, Mrs. P, I'll deal with this.
J1_CUT1_50	D39E0D67	~z~I need these guys if we're ever gonna be taken serious...
J1_CUT1_51	E1EFAA0A	~z~you know, get on the Commission.
J1_CUT1_52	3722546E	~z~Now the thing is, these guys ain't, shall we say...
J1_CUT1_53	45CCF1C3	~z~shown us the appropriate respect in the past.
J1_CUT1_54	38895738	~z~I want you... to run security.
J1_CUT1_55	46B7F395	~z~Keep an eye on things, 'cause they won't be looking out for you.
J1_CUT1_56	1C0E9E43	~z~Ah, here they are, it's either them or the cops.
J1_CUT1_57	2A443AAE	~z~It's them, they're outside. Looks like Ray's here too.
J1_CUT1_58	6193294B	~z~I know it's them. God, give me strength...
J1_CUT1_59	6F5D44DF	~z~l'll be out in a minute. Look after Ray 'til I get back.
