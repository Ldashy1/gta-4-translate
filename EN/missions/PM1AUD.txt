	A61E070C	~z~We're going this way.
	A67B7E98	PM1_TC
	A605E1A5	100
	A3E7EBB7	PM1_DAF
	A3FDEFA0	~z~So?
	A9EE91B1	~z~You should come along next time.
	AA26E3AA	~z~Anyone who hangs around my family hears about the old days. Just wait.
	A8DB9723	PM1_LB
	A78D76C7	~z~Shit, man. I keep forgetting you're not from here.
	A79BB85C	PM1_DR
	A2DEA30C	~z~We wouldn't be working for him if our family still had the same status it did back in the day.
	9EAF0BBC	PM1_JA
	9F0AED27	PM1_DV
	9BECE865	PM1_DAI
	9ADE7010	~z~See you round, Niko.
	9B6A70F1	PM1_CM
	A0A59301	~z~Why don't they make these places easier to break into?
	A0BF3E03	PM1_JI
	9F54CE06	~z~Oh yeah, Ray Boccino's a slimy motherfucker. The one thing you can rely on him for is greed.
	9F0F873B	~z~Saving someone's life has got to count for something in this fucked up age we live in.
	9F40A830	~z~Hurry up, you bastard. What's the problem?
	B8C0ED54	011101
	BBA4F96A	~z~Hey, what do you think you're doing?
	B7C2E73E	~z~That's great. That's just fucking great. We lost the stuff.
	B34AE9F7	100100
	B5C5C7BE	~z~Let us drive in fucking peace, you cocksuckers.
	BF1232E9	PM1_TB
	BF265750	PM1_JC
	BE285A7D	PM1_DAA
	BC40F44F	PM1_GD
	BD3BBE39	~z~Don't these triads have other stuff they need to fuck with?
	B29A9F55	~z~Don't you got other guys to help you out? You're from here, you should know everyone.
	ADCF02F9	~z~That's a lesson I've learnt. Fucking Boccino said it'd be easy.
	AE69B1A1	PM1_CAF
	AC5C9ECD	PM1_CJ
	AADDED74	PM1_MB
	AB7C332B	~z~Get away from the truck. Don't you know when you're beat?
	B0BFAA9B	~z~That's why you're on this job with me.
	B17B4CA5	~z~Come on, ain't you fit enough for this work?

	AF155AB9	PM1_WA
	8778A630	PM1_A_BA

	876E34FF	101101101011101101011101101011
	850FDBCA	~z~You better be right about this shipment. If it's just fish I'm gonna be pretty irritated, Packie.
	865BEA07	~z~What makes you think that the information is legit?
	8AA8DFEC	~z~Yeah. Stuff that'll stop housewives cutting their wrists and make their husbands get wood.
	8AB2C237	PM1_DT
	8A5C11B5	~z~This is where the deal's meant to be going down.
	898F9691	PM1_GC
	8A4BCEA8	~z~And I know what happens to a man when he ain't getting any. It ain't pretty.
	84888993	PM1_DZ
	7EFEDA31	~z~Possession is nine tenths of the law. Deal with it.
	7F033C20	PM1_JF
	7EC63B61	~z~Shut the fuck up. You think you're a right fuckin' comedian, don't ya?
	7B36BACB	010
	7D1F099B	~z~Makes sense.
	83CE5B3F	PM1_CAE

	804FE264	390
	81986EC9	PM1_CF
	949A0683	~z~First off, I don't trust this guinea for a second.
	951F14F0	PM1_CAJ
	93ED7985	~z~This place really wasn't made with us criminals in mind.
	919D5D8E	~z~Shit, we nearly had it. That was a fucking screw up if I ever saw one.
	919E025F	100
	9A27DBAD	PM1_DY
	9ACC6501	~z~Jump down there, man. Have at 'em.
	99490EC5	~z~Go back to the docks where you belong.
	95696277	PM1_DD
	986B7B71	~z~Meds. Mollis, sedatives, antidepressants - meds.
	915C87EE	PM1_DN
	8D361ACA	PM1_JD
	8D4BC23C	~z~But, if it's going to the fish market they must be saying that it's fish.
	8CD854E2	~z~Meds?
	8C0E0229	PM1_DQ
	8C416A31	~z~We'll wait until the truck is loaded then we'll take it. Simple as that.
	91564A59	~z~The fish market smells fishy?
	9159C23A	PM1_BA
	913C7EAC	~z~These are ours now. Fuck off.
	8E2E9242	PM1_DO
	8E84AC66	~z~I'm too small time to be worth setting up so the one angle he can be playing is the cash one.
	BF7CA654	~z~They do not like to be robbed, I guess. Not many people do.
	E5D514C5	~z~You can't trust people. I only trust me family, some of them at least, and people I don't know.
	E661175B	~z~Okay, how do we do it?
	E5A405B7	PM1_CAN
	E1D33CAF	~z~I'll cover you from up here while you're down on the ground cleaning up.
	E352EE13	PM1_CV
	E9D30F0B	~z~We've got business out at the docks in Algonquin.
	EB40A5EC	~z~Not in this country. In Europe. They do things different there.
	E9C00768	PM1_TA
	E6E7E2BF	PM1_CP
	E7CF1CD9	PM1_DH
	E1A952B2	~z~Depends on what you think is fun.
	DA0277C6	~z~Persistent motherfuckers, aren't they?
	DA427C58	~z~What the hell...? Is it Chinese New Year already?
	D9D59F13	PM1_DP
	D8FC0163	~z~General population. That's a prison term. You ever been inside?
	D922D9A0	~z~They're taking this real serious, aren't they?
	DCCB21BA	PM1_DS
	DDC497BB	~z~Get away from the fucking truck.
	DC631614	~z~All we know is that it's worth a dollar or two.
	DB997506	~z~Yes?
	DC589FB9	101
	F8884D42	~z~Fuck off back to Chinatown or wherever you triads hang out.
	FAD8F3C2	PM1_JF
	F754C378	PM1_DI
	F68CAEC2	090090
	F71416B5	PM1_CS
	FEA2BB18	~z~Learn the damn language.
	FF6A79BF	~z~What's the plan?
	FD8CFA4A	PM1_JE
	FCDE493B	~z~It don't happen on the other side of the ocean.
	FCE49694	PM1_JH
	F49EB3D6	~z~We'll wait until the truck is loaded then we'll take it. Simple as that.
	F02E3DAA	~z~My brother Gerald had word about it through this Italian, Ray Boccino.
	F085B532	PM1_DF
	EF72BB17	~z~Stay away from us, you shitheads.
	EB859588	100
	ECF454D3	~z~Alright, here we are.
	F30F490B	PM1_CAK
	F3529812	PM1_IA
	F2E7F52F	~z~Yeah, he'll probably try to give us a fraction of whatever this stuff's worth but it'll be a fun night.
	F0F89FC4	~z~If that's what's going through your brain then we've got ourselves a problem.
	F2B021DF	PM1_CK
	C58885FC	~z~We get up on the roof of that warehouse.
	C5CD54BA	~z~get into fights on a nightly basis and die young leaving a scarred, bloated corpse.
	C4E0A7D7	PM1_VA
	C302C1E2	PM1_JD
	C44B4C58	~z~Jesus Christ, I'm getting sick of these fucking triads.
	C64B609B	PM1_OA
	C73AFAD1	100010100100
	C61E9EED	PM1_CR
	C5EFE812	~z~Take your defeat like real men. Fuck off.
	C5F69B4D	~z~Usual for you and me maybe. The general population, I am not so sure.
	C2D96D1B	PM1_DL
	C1565FFB	~z~Who are we welcoming and what have they got that makes this drive worth the effort?
	C18E4DBA	~z~This is where the deal's meant to be going down.
	C115846B	~z~Let's kill these thieves!
	C02F49A9	100100
	C0D43BC8	~z~I think me and you could get along. I need a guy like you on our team.
	C28156B4	~z~Alright, Niko. You drive. I'll take out anyone who tries to follow us.
	C2884E2C	~z~Because you don't know me?
	C227B3CA	PM1_DAH
	C1BA0CF1	~z~Where's your car, man? We need a car.
	C2242D05	PM1_DX

	D6759100	PM1_CAL
	D33B2161	~z~There should be a good view of the dock so we can scope that shit out.
	D15C3230	PM1_DA
	D2D4E079	~z~Stick to me, man.
	D835580E	~z~My brother Gerry's had word from Ray Boccino, his Italian contact,
	D8483FF0	~z~Stealing, gunfire, car chases, all the usual stuff.
	D7BE68BC	PM1_CD
	D6805E75	011101101
	D7987850	~z~That sound like the sort of life worth saving?
	D035F2FB	PM1_DG
	CC91874E	PM1_CH
	CD5B588A	~z~Anyways, I was in Algonquin last night, partying with some sweet college chicks.
	CC2169F4	~z~We're going to Ray's lockup in Westminster off of Union Drive West.
	C8F5F329	~z~Jesus, watch where you're going!
	CC052780	100
	CF44E927	~z~And here's the boat, right on time.
	CF5B20F6	~z~Stupid Americans are trying to rob us!
	CF041711	~z~These better be some good fucking pills. The housewives better be grateful.
	CE837690	~z~This ain't no fireworks display. It's a fucking assault rifle.
	CEA8FAA0	~z~We're welcoming some of our cousins from the East, but we don't know what it is that they're bringing in exactly.
	7A694417	PM1_DB

	2D27180C	PM1_CA
	30E9C32B	~z~Fuck me, that did not look pretty.
	3130E458	101011
	30E88977	~z~Something smellin' fishy means that it ain't quite right.
	2F355121	PM1_CAM
	2FFFE42D	100100100010100100100010100010100100100010100010100100100010100100010100010100100100010100100100010100100010100100100010
	2BD0A5A7	~z~Not in a "fun in the showers" kind of way. In a male bonding, about to go rob some people, kind of way.
	2826638A	~z~And here's the boat, right on time.
	282A7C88	PM1_DU
	27F8EC94	101
	262596E7	~z~See those boxes on the back of the boat? They must be bringing cloned meds.
	27208EFB	PM1_CI
	2A5EA42F	~z~Well, you've got to do some time over here. See what you've been missing out on in your chaste European jails.
	2B299065	~z~Oh yeah?
	2951F5F6	PM1_RA
	2873147D	~z~That's if we're ever going to get out of this fuckin' jam. Put your foot down, man.
	28874B9A	PM1_JA
	3E52FB5C	PM1_JC
	3F6750CA	100
	3CB3476C	~z~I think I know what you are saying.
	3BDD5146	~z~There's a billion of these motherfuckers back in China, they won't miss a few.
	3C86331E	~z~So, you got yourself a girlfriend, Packie?
	4297C8F3	~z~They're fucking ramming us. Shit.
	43855504	PM1_XA

	3FBDF790	PM1_PA
	40527A10	PM1_JB
	3A9D116A	PM1_CX
	33E23732	~z~Did no one pay you any attention?
	3417A601	~z~Sure, sure, guy like you. You'd have a good time.
	33BF321A	~z~Meds?
	32ED7F32	~z~I get here on my own time.
	32F32678	~z~Fuck off. We just want the damn shipment.
	35356793	PM1_JB
	368B1A99	100010100100
	34D0B7E2	PM1_YA
	34711090	~z~about a big shipment coming in near the fish market.
	34B22706	PM1_CL
	25E4899B	~z~Really?
	0D6AE3F0	~z~That, and you saved my life.
	0F10EDA0	~z~As I said, the whole prison bitch thing is an American phenomenon.
	0B0C5263	~z~Most definitely.
	0A664F9B	~z~Follow me, Niko.
	0AAC6AE0	100
	127672EF	~z~We would see if they'd be able to touch me, I got some moves.
	136A13D2	PM1_CG
	115A44A1	PM1_UA
	0FA0AE98	~z~Am I going to hear this story?
	102952DA	PM1_TD
	0A4FC84E	PM1_A_AA
	0427D652	~z~You'd be touched if you did some time, that's for sure.
	04648B89	PM1_GB
	0270C2B4	~z~Unless you're hoping to see me sis again?
	00063B6F	PM1_CN
	01E03DD3	~z~Some guys I know have checked you out as well.
	079E7C99	PM1_CAD
	0A192A09	PM1_CO
	064F5AA5	~z~Will do. Might even put you on the visitors list.
	0557DA1A	~z~Not so much of the "fun in the shower" that you guys have here in America.
	063FC692	~z~It usually means you don't, right?
	21B59517	~z~Okay, how do we do it?
	21E4B6DB	PM1_JJ
	21A2249C	~z~Hell, I didn't think I was coming out here with a special needs kid.
	202BB033	PM1_JI
	216F924D	~z~Bet a guy like you thought he was going to be real popular with the lifers.
	23E0EF1B	~z~Good thing I enjoy a good ruck.
	25D1DF2A	PM1_CQ
	23859537	PM1_CAH
	2299AB36	PM1_DM
	22AB8201	PM1_CC
	1F9F5376	100
	17977E99	~z~Must have been a real disappointment.
	188F0090	~z~I'm going to pass on that. Send me a postcard if you do some time.
	14997739	~z~I'd be fucking touched.
	1395A2BE	PM1_JH
	1436627F	~z~I do and I don't if you know what I mean?
	1ABFC98E	PM1_MA
	1D9A893B	~z~You're a good man, Niko. I like you.
	1A52C3FC	~z~But that's another story.
	19BF6151	190
	1A46CE6D	100
	44E8CD68	~z~I thought you had the luck of the Irish?
	68A58497	PM1_DAD
	68F06B91	100010100100
	681110B3	~z~Shut up and let us rob you. Jesus.

	67C9FB93	PM1_CZ
	6B77C3E9	PM1_SA
	6BA29243	PM1_JE
	6A6D2E65	~z~You dumpling-eating motherfuckers.
	69AEBD80	PM1_JJ
	6A200F72	~z~Yeah. Stuff that'll stop housewives cutting their wrists and make their husbands get wood.
	6228A1AD	~z~Okay, there's a ship coming in and we're the welcoming party.
	63623D99	~z~This is America, assholes. The strongest survive.
	5E59FD45	~z~This is import tax, deal with it.
	5D3A8392	~z~That depends on the life, I guess.
	5D5774C0	~z~The problem's that you'll be letting yourself in for a lifetime without getting action.
	661A7DE5	PM1_DAJ
	677AC9B8	~z~These better be some good fucking pills. The housewives better be grateful.
	64B67DDD	PM1_DAE
	6420766F	PM1_DW
	649DA33A	100
	76959A32	PM1_CW
	781ECD8D	~z~He gave us the heads up in exchange for a cut of the haul.
	730A10DB	PM1_CY

	727D637D	PM1_DAB
	79DEB44E	~z~You fucking triad bastards!
	79E4DE4A	PM1_CE
	79503F30	010
	783750B8	PM1_DJ
	7856ABDF	~z~Meds. Mollis, sedatives, antidepressants - meds.
	6EB420FE	~z~Shit, Niko. These cocksuckers are all over us.
	6F30277D	~z~Tell you what, I'll snort a load of rails, fuck a lot of drunk girls,
	6E9E6CB0	PM1_CAB
	6C123FCD	101
	6CEAA1AA	~z~There's a box of grenades in here. Pass some up, Packie - I'll give them a taste of their own fireworks.
	71CAB0A0	PM1_CAG
	72259C38	PM1_JG
	714CCED0	PM1_CAC
	70AA2517	~z~Dammit, they just don't give up.
	710C9FEE	~z~So if this shipment is what they say it is, then it's going to smell fishy anyway.
	4F86E12F	PM1_LA
	4F56AD01	PM1_CAA
	4F425896	~z~Ha. You're a perceptive guy. I got the lowdown on you from Elizabeta.
	541F6BD5	~z~I fuckin' do. It's just that we've got your fuckin' Slavic driving skills as well.
	54B48AC0	~z~Don't have much in the way of coordination do ya?
	546471E6	~z~That's the fucking problem, everyone in the neighborhood... hell, in the whole fucking city knows us.
	542C87C7	PM1_DK
	49CA5E30	~z~I'll cover you from up here while you're down on the ground cleaning up.
	4791B6C9	~z~So, this shipment smellin' fishy means that it ain't gonna be what they say it is.
	499EAF9B	100
	4B1F3DEC	~z~The triads are expecting something and it smells fishy.
	4E27F5DB	~z~Put that in your wok and fry it.
	4DDB4566	PM1_CT
	4CA359D8	~z~Take some of your anti depressants if you're that damn upset about us robbing ya.
	5A0C07D5	PM1_QA

	4675EE43	~z~You're going to hurt yourself if you keep that up, boy.
	57E58956	~z~I just can't be bothered with this shit.
	5AAFD88B	PM1_HA
PM1_CUT1_1	8E5DFEBE	~z~All I'm saying is that we'll all be judged in the end, all of your brothers...
PM1_CUT1_10	04271102	~z~Good. 'Cause I ain't fucking got none.
PM1_CUT1_11	16EDB68F	~z~Very funny.
PM1_CUT1_12	699D5BED	~z~Maybe if being a drunkard doesn't work out you can be a comedian.
PM1_CUT1_13	7B56FF60	~z~Fuck off...
PM1_CUT1_14	43610F75	~z~and you, Kate, fuck off outta here.
PM1_CUT1_15	4E2324F9	~z~But aren't you going to introduce us?
PM1_CUT1_16	A0AA4A0A	~z~Sure.
PM1_CUT1_17	B2F0EE97	~z~This is Niko, some drug dealing de-fucking-generate from some armpit in Eastern Europe.
PM1_CUT1_18	FA7CFDAE	~z~That's my ma.
PM1_CUT1_19	840A10CA	~z~Nice to meet you.
PM1_CUT1_2	E64E2E9D	~z~and you, Patrick. And you, Kate!
PM1_CUT1_20	5488BDD4	~z~Hi.
PM1_CUT1_21	36C4824C	~z~And this is my sister. Lovely lass.
PM1_CUT1_22	AB0EEB5B	~z~Scared to bits of life. And fucking off outta here right now, before I throw a fuckin' bottle at her.
PM1_CUT1_23	98D3C6E5	~z~Patrick!
PM1_CUT1_24	3B2B8B36	~z~Nice to meet you.
PM1_CUT1_25	491AA714	~z~Likewise, see you around.
PM1_CUT1_26	978BC3F1	~z~Bye.
PM1_CUT1_27	B3A1FC1D	~z~What a girl!
