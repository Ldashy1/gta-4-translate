	975CF6AC	~z~Ohh, my doctor has all my best interests at heart. He's a real sweetie.

	90BEB34F	~z~I don't know if they're the reason that I'm on edge or if it's from worrying about what the pills might do to me.
	90A3B31D	~z~The fucking driver was there, why did I have to be there too? No I think it's the pills.
	97573D2D	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LF

	AE7A6C91	~z~I've had the worst day. It's like everyone has been talking at me and no one has been listening to what I have to say.
	A49CD990	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KJ
	A40E3B8D	~z~I'm sorry to hear that.

	A7D00528	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NG
	A72DD9E1	~z~Yeah you. I don't know much about you, you're a man of mystery. Where you from? Spain isn't? Oh! Was that the other guy?
	A5BE423C	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JD
	7FA47352	~z~You better show me a good time tonight.
	7F8A7286	~z~You do well. I should have done less.
	7E1028F1	~z~Shit. I'm on meds and they're not working well at all.
	82E5179C	~z~I'm a bit nervous because I can't really tell what the new pills are going to do to you.
	82AEE843	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MQ
	80CEF3F1	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JP
	79AB89FE	~z~Very special.
	784D687B	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JG
	75DC5F2A	~z~I still hate life. I'm a failure. I should have done more.
	7D6C865F	~z~Well, you want to know?
	7AD278AD	~z~I knew it. You are so lucky to have me. I imagine I bring adventure to your life.
	7A311E97	~z~You know what the worst thing is? What makes me hate her the most?
	8C1E82BB	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IN
	8ACD2120	~z~I knew it - what else? Tell me stuff, for my blog.
	8A92BBED	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MB
	90162D28	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JI
	8F1E2144	~z~Ha fucking ha. What do you really do?
	8D3F44B3	~z~"Alex, why are all my friends reading about your sex life on the internet?",
	843086A8	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MC
	83C4FBF3	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NA
	82E617A2	~z~Or I might be angry because I had to go with my mother while she got chemo.
	89DABDEA	~z~Did you?
	864E320B	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KK
	852495CB	~z~Okay - I'm a hitman, who works for organized crime syndicates.
	E474F321	~z~It's that I feel like I owe her something. For bringing me into the world.
	E3403221	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IM
	DD5FC5E6	~z~She's dependent on me but I'm the child, I mean she's the adult.
	ED30A25E	~z~You are so funny. Ha fucking ha. You're not being a fucking smart ass are you?
	EB436676	~z~It's like a twenty-first century uptown boy, downtown girl story.
	E5E750D9	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JH
	DADA2D98	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NF
	DAC5DC6A	~z~money and a greencard? You'd be the envy of every border jumper in the nation.
	D865C0BB	~z~It's Cinderella but with a gender reversal and the internet playing fairy godmother.

	FE6CA9AC	~z~I would love your problems.
	FCF089D0	~z~I mean, you really care. I think in some weird way we could be soul mates, you know?
	FC5A679E	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JK
	F183567A	~z~What's wrong? You seem sad.
	EF40A3BB	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IE
	EEE25690	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NE
	F51FD43F	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MO
	F4238F25	~z~I think this would be a dream I would sooner wake up from.
	F3676AC9	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IH
	C2A31BE8	~z~I think you're okay. I think you are just being a human being. That's what my cousin told me, when I was like you.
	C22340D8	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KR
	C199684B	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MK
	C7139E17	~z~I don't see it like that.
	C643D485	~z~The only reason guys become psychiatrists is to get with young, anorexic pill poppers.
	C4B70B00	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MH
	B67FA1A7	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NH
	B4993130	~z~Niko, you are so not from around here.

	B7291531	~z~I hadn't really thought about settling down.
	D6C257BC	~z~For paying my rent every month. I feel like I have to meet her for lunch twice a week, like it's an obligation.
	D6BEAE0C	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IF
	D57E0A58	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_ML
	D828F84F	~z~I lost my virginity to him. That shows you how long I've been pouring my heart out on the couch.
	D7FABB1C	~z~That cancer spreading into her abdomen was the best thing that ever happened to me. I hate her.
	D7F58EC9	010100010100010100010100010100010100010100010
	CC883FEF	~z~I bet you do. Every guy from your background must dream about marrying into money. Think about it -
	CBD68B13	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JO
	CB2509BE	~z~Nothing. I mean ha fucking ha, little rich girl, all depressed, can't write a book.
	D17CD78F	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KD
	D0ADE2C1	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KH
	CCA14616	~z~Knowing that I can do whatever I want, and it means nothing. I mean nothing matters. Do you know how that feels?
	28EA19C8	~z~He's in love with me, you know. I've been seeing him forever.
	25975658	~z~I hope you don't really mean that...
	24D37084	~z~This story is marketable. It could be the arc my novel needs. It might give everything structure. Do you want to get married?
	2B3FE857	~z~Fine, Niko, just fucking fine.
	2940B682	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MJ
	292952E4	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IG
	216F52CD	~z~It must be very difficult for you. I am sure you have been saying a lot.
	1F99C205	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_II
	1D794CCA	~z~So, Alex, how's it going?
	23E38AC0	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IC
	23AAF42C	~z~No. I still know my own name. I wanna forget.
	2332DD06	~z~Okay. Have it your way.
	34436B90	~z~My life ended many years ago when I saw my childhood friends butchered on a hillside.
	342E5BCF	~z~Sure. But you seem strong.
	32B10F98	~z~I hope it isn't something I've done.
	361016DB	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LO
	34FE00A0	~z~I'm pathetic. Look at me.
	34667F6D	~z~Thanks, but I really don't think you can understand how I feel...

	316B2ACE	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KA
	3083CF9F	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IJ
	3048F080	~z~but no one has really listened.
	0E9FA869	~z~Yeah, well, I'm happy she's dying.
	0D42C09E	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LI
	0B2F0B73	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NL
	1008B6B2	~z~I'm sorry... I'm just... I'm just special.
	0FD72F9D	~z~Exactly. God I feel like sometimes you're the only one who really listens.
	0F339D19	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JE
	01860616	~z~I'm a one man crime wave who has killed indiscriminately since I turned up here, but inside I just want to be loved.
	0110A71A	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LJ
	00CD0CC4	~z~I think you are old enough to be classified as an adult now.

	19562C6F	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_ND
	11ED50AD	~z~Absolutely.
	1130A56B	~z~Loved or killed I guess, I don't know which.
	111E6A39	~z~And the only reason girls become anorexic and start popping pills is to get with older guys. It's a match made in Heaven.
	15385747	~z~No?
	131E049B	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MM
	11F02F64	~z~What's up, Alex?
	658D7D5E	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KF
	6494D456	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IA
	6310E545	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LK
	69F59BEA	~z~Isn't that a breach of the doctor patient relationship thing?
	694B1291	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KS
	66905EF7	~z~I'm sorry, it's just my doctor put me on some new meds and I haven't quite leveled out yet.
	601F3448	~z~No you don't. Not in the way I mean. You couldn't possibly know how much I suffer.
	5CC08298	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KB
	5C22B48A	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JC
	62FC702E	~z~It's fucking Mother. It's all - "Alex do this?", "Alex, when are you going to meet a nice man?
	625447E5	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JA
	617AE9D2	~z~They'd say Niko Bellic - The American Dream.

	7450FA78	~z~Yeah, I can see.
	7265704D	~z~Me?
	6D684EDA	~z~No pressure then.
	6CA64F84	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NM
	6C8CDC22	~z~I work in... construction.
	708A24F8	GCA2_ALEX_MOTHER_IB
	6FC68C5E	~z~How are you?
	6F9FD7D1	100010100100100010100100100100010100100010

	451D391A	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KG
	427542EE	GCA2_ALEX_SHRINK_KI
	473ABB47	~z~Yep. I guess... I guess... I guess it just hurts knowing as much as I do.
	463A1C06	~z~I mean... ok they've like, taken the cab to where I told them to take it, or they've got me the right size of shoe...
	45CCFF0C	~z~I act all tough, but inside I'm just a little girl. I used to be anorexic.
	3A70DCB4	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LQ
	39970505	~z~Okay, maybe this date is not such a good idea. If you are in this type of mood...
	38AB1E28	~z~You're a very up and down girl.
	40EA16DC	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LD
	3F80A937	~z~"Alex, did you really sleep with the gardener at our place upstate?".
	3D63F86D	GCA2_ALEX_MYSTERY_JB
	56A9A0C9	~z~Well, I do and I tell you what, rich people have feelings too.
	531226A0	GCA2_ALEX_BAD_DAY_MI
	51DE97C7	~z~I guess not.
	5A92E52C	GCA2_ALEX_RICH_FEELINGS_LL
	59CBBF1A	~z~That was me.
	58E425D4	GCA2_ALEX_SUFFER_NK
	4BFA4226	~z~Oh god, I'm so fucking angry.
	4A081719	~z~Sure.
	48A41CCB	~z~Too many things to mention. It's been crazy. Wild and liberated, the whole nine. What about you?
	4FB8C64E	~z~Dish washers, gardeners and valets would put posters of you on their walls.
	4CE88D47	~z~I thought you were liberated? I didn't think you got sad?
	4C0AE009	~z~Didn't the doctor tell you what the side effects of the meds were going to be?
