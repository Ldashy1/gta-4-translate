	AC6392E7	~z~There you are cousin, let's move.
	AE648245	~z~This is a good idea. I think you'll look so much better in a suit or something. It's Roman's big day.
	AFA7CC7A	~z~I'll wait for you here, Niko. I'd like to get to know the groom.
	AECCF58A	FIN1E_IO
	AE9B50C5	~z~That there is a real human being under all that hardness.
	AAE4D2A3	FIN1E_ON
	A12D8503	400
	A089D992	~z~Because I'm going to the wedding of a couple I've never met with a man I barely know.
	9FEF42B4	FIN1E_OT
	A1A793E3	~z~Maybe. The right person can make your life wonderful in the same way that the wrong one can ruin it.
	A9642738	FIN1E_FA
	A60D2412	FIN1E_FE
	A3CC9995	~z~Well maybe they are. I don't want to be involved with the men I have been involved with.
	B1517B1D	~z~Why is this weird?
	BE90FD67	FIN1E_IU
	BCBC699B	~z~Maybe you're right, Roman has been hurt.
	BC61B230	~z~Thanks for coming to get me. You're looking really nice. Shall we go to the church?
	BEC81293	FIN1E_IAJ
	C1B2B8FA	~z~I might steal the collection box if the mood takes me though.
	C0ED5DD6	~z~Are you prepared to say goodbye to the fast cars, the drugs, the violence, the cheap women?
	BF135022	~z~Recently, I have tied up a lot of loose ends in this city.
	BB667F1E	FIN1E_IX
	B36C376C	~z~Yeah? Do you think that that is the answer for everyone then?
	B1F9B2B5	~z~Can you pick me up and take me there? I'll be at my ma's.
	B18EB519	~z~You're talking about your criminal exploits as if they are a thing of the past.
	B48386E0	FIN1E_OAB
	B7031F30	FIN1E_OR
	B6F35AA4	FIN1E_IAB

	827BC9C5	FIN1E_IS
	7F9E17B7	~z~So?
	8B0266E5	~z~You remember how that turned out?
	8CDFB23A	~z~So... what?
	8C910A6D	FIN1E_IA
	8B82F2CA	~z~Yes, I am.
	7D08AFA7	~z~Oh really?
	780A6F45	FIN1E_FC
	77C8B37F	FIN1E_IR
	77134707	~z~Oh, I didn't realize it was going to be such a casual service. Shall we go to the church?
	781E4235	~z~After the war, I was involved in a life I felt was not for me.
	7868FE7F	FIN1E_IJ
	785DF5A2	FIN1E_IY
	785DCC80	~z~It would be easier to be happy if I was with the right person though.
	8CE11A44	FIN1E_OV
	9BD1AA1A	~z~But the other half says he's good, he can be redeemed.
	986302BA	~z~I have tried to separate myself from it. I am ready to try to be good.
	96C4A303	FIN1E_IAH
	9C035081	~z~So... this is weird.
	9F9A3F5C	FIN1E_FB
	9D64AAF4	FIN1E_IB
	9D53CEEC	FIN1E_IL
	931FB55C	FIN1E_OX
	8E2FD1F5	~z~Will you fire a gun into the air as your cousin walks down the aisle?
	8DD50241	FIN1E_IF
	8D248652	FIN1E_OAD
	909522D0	FIN1E_IV

	914D9C25	FIN1E_OP
	91225315	~z~Look at you in those fancy clothes, Niko. Trying to upstage the groom on his wedding day? Let's get me married.

	EE9A5B2D	FIN1E_OM
	E8241F09	~z~Well it was the right thing to do. Are you coming to Roman's wedding?
	E3744AC5	FIN1E_IT_QQQ1
	E2C7A0DA	~z~Niko, what are you doing? I told you to dress up. We will wait. Go and change, quickly.
	E2A7A116	~z~There's nothing else I can say.
	E4EC6795	FIN1E_MA

	E564BDDA	FIN1E_IAC
	E4F73EE6	FIN1E_OI
	F31F9BF3	~z~You know, it's not that weird to think that there might be some shooting at this wedding,
	FA5110B4	~z~I'm not sure about those clothes.
	F8A046DC	400
	F6115C58	~z~If I can get pulled into this world I can pull myself out.

	FE26EFFF	~z~Really?
	FCB42971	FIN1E_OQ
	FBB3C84A	~z~It's hard to say, but maybe the right person.
	F5CCBBBD	FIN1E_OAJ
	F3BD7362	FIN1E_OW
	F33ED6A3	~z~He has lost a lot because of me.
	F3248263	~z~I can't believe you'd wear that to a church.
	F3D67DF3	FIN1E_IAK
	F4FBF3AB	FIN1E_OY
	F47406F3	FIN1E_EA
	F444D9CF	~z~I was good once, I was a normal kid who got sucked into a war he didn't believe in
	CB2A0845	FIN1E_IAF
	CA8108B4	~z~He might be your only family, but he's not the only one who cares about you, Niko.
	C6374203	~z~Yeah, I'll mug any nuns that are hanging around the church as well.
	CC5DFA7B	400
	CE2C0C7E	~z~Has your cousin been caught up in your mad life?

	D67A1958	~z~Here we are.
	DC8B09A9	~z~The problem is that it's difficult to tell which one the man you are with is.
	E2878C8B	FIN1E_IQ_QQQ1
	E114B8FB	400
	DF6A10C7	~z~Are you?
	D6767BAE	~z~I'm really proud of you, Niko. It must have been really hard to turn down the money and stick to your principles.
	D16D3950	FIN1E_ACT_ARRIVEC_NOTLATE_BA
	D047F173	~z~When I think about him I just wish that he'd been happy in his life.

	27FEABC3	~z~They will have to. I am not a slave.
	27F7414B	~z~Do you just think you can just walk away from all that?
	27C2DF70	FIN1E_IH
	2863C0EC	~z~Tell me, have these good people been hurt by what you've had to do?
	2D364BB1	~z~But, do you think the men you've dealt with will just let you leave and walk into the sunset?
	2BC7B4EF	FIN1E_OJ
