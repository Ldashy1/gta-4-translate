	213799BA	~z~If that shit, Pegorino, understands the worth of his life, it will be all the more satisfying to take it away from him.
	20E69D5D	~z~He cannot go much further, we must reach Pegorino soon.
	276B98A4	~z~You have to do what you have to do, cousin. If he tried to kill you then, he will try to kill you again.
