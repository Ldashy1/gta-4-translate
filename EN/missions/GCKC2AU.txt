	AE9B0733	~z~No. Not really. I was trying to be more optimistic. My shrink tells me I need to be more optimistic
	A7DEC4E7	~z~No you don't. You don't like anything. You tolerate me, like you tolerate life.

	A4B4487E	~z~He's my brother, but he's an idiot. You're not.
	A890B2FC	~z~This is a good thing to do, you will help people. You should go back to school and become a teacher.

	8F548088	~z~I don't know. I think life can be simple if you let it be. I think that life can have meaning.
	8EC54697	~z~I want to be a whole one. I do not want to be owned by anyone.
	924E715B	~z~Sometimes I do not call my life survival, it is somewhere below that, but yeah. I take your point.
	921CCE37	~z~Why don't you get involved with someone?

	8BBD6017	~z~Yes, good... no... no. I'm terrible.
	92710567	GCK2_FRIENDS_ML
	A16F6BEB	~z~It isn't a difficult question if you don't care about the answer. What kind of a man do I want to be?
	A0C42367	~z~I want to be productive, I want to help people, I think that if I went back to school and became a teacher...

	F29C2DD3	~z~I'm tired of this life - tired of this city.
	F266A2D1	~z~The very idea I think about having a family given my genes is shameful.
	E84DA113	~z~Thank you. I like you.
	E5D5A776	GCK2_POINT_KC
	E20BB944	~z~So you could do this until you've killed everyone? Or until you die? Your life must be hell.
	E1D49042	~z~Okay, we're both survivors then. Maybe that's why we like each other.

	230B7B54	~z~What is it that makes us get on?
	2278DADF	GCK2_PSYCHOS_LC
	282E8586	~z~We have scars that come from these horrible situations and we can live to tell the tale.
	27B7C480	~z~Doesn't really matter, you'll probably die tomorrow.
	26A6427C	~z~I don't think men can change.

	64F4E035	GCK2_DATING_JK
	6480715E	~z~So you care what your "friend" wants to do with his life?
	63E89490	~z~We have survived. That's what life is about - survival.

	63BEDFAE	GCK2_PSYCHOS_LE
	50F0EEA1	~z~Maybe that is why we get on. We're friends. I like you Kate. I really do.

	53E050CE	~z~Okay, you want an answer? What sort of man do I want to be?
	4BF9D882	~z~It's the period between trips to the laundromat or calls from my mother or dates with you.
	47945F9F	~z~I really like you. I mean, not like that. I'm not into that. Not with you.
	462A54F2	~z~We don't have to be friends anymore, if it upsets you.
	3FE4A827	~z~Here you are, coming with the big questions straight out of the gate. Give me a break.
	4BC0027F	GCK2_OPTIMISM_NF
	4934506B	~z~Good. Because I don't want to think about it. I hang out with you to forget about that life.
	47D6C4EA	~z~Our mutual interest in wine, conversation, art house movies and long walks on the beach...
	54BB5E9F	~z~Alright, why do we both understand that?
