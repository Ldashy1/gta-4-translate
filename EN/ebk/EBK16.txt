	8C25366E	So, after all that, you found a heart, eh? Good for you. Now, move on. Give up this life you have chosen. The net is closing in on a bunch of your colleagues and associates. I would not want you to get caught up in what is sure to be a bloody business.

A word to the wise, the people you are consorting with in Alderney are fools and they are not to be trusted. I know other people who will help you.
