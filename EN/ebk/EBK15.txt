	C0D80645	The only award Roman will win is fantasist of the year. I hope you are well. Look after yourself. Love, Niko.
	BDB3F542	I hear Roman is getting married! I am so excited. I also heard you had a nice girl, and you could not seem to commit to her? I wish I could make it to the wedding. Have a good time, my son. I am so proud of you both. s ljubavlju,

	ADB4551B	He is not a professional wrestler, but I get the sense he still likes to wrestle with men as keen amateur. We have met many people, but most of them have little power and are controlled only by money. Life is strange here. One friend of Roman's likes to inject himself with shark testosterone. These are the kind of people we know here.

	EFA89ABA	Dear mother, thanks for your mail. Life in America is okay, thank you for your concern. I wish Roman would join me from his time spent living in clouds. He makes things up, I don't know why. He has a nice woman in his life, that is true, the rest is lies. Apart from Florian Cravic. We have seen him. He is very different.

	E89BCB11	I was thinking about you, and I thought I write. I receive nice e mail from your cousin. He say you had seen Florian Cravic again. Did he become a professional wrestler, as he say? He was always strange boy. Roman also tells me he has woman nice in his life and that maybe there was someone special for you too. Life here is much same - crops grow,

	2BA2D11E	Nadam se da si dobro i da si srecan u Americi. I hope this reaches you and you respond. I miss you. I write in English because now you are like Roman. He tells me he only speaks English now. I know things better for you to be out in world, and away from here, but I miss you. It is mother's duty to miss son. Are you no longer in sea? Have you stopped that world for good, or will you go back? Will you ever come back to me? It gladdens heart of mine to think of you and your cousin together, living a good life in America, and at the same time,
	4BDA9191	the country flounders, British people come to buy holiday homes they never visit, the politicians argue and we all want things will change. I have long memory. Life always confusing uncertain. Only problems change. We have never known freedom, and nor democracy. Sometimes, I think this makes realist life easier for us.
	3EE77B74	Moj dragi sine,
	1D323441	Word in the village is that Roman was killed on wedding day. I know it is true, as I checked on internet. My son, my heart is broken. Please leave evil place. Please go somewhere safe. Please do not caught up in madness. Please do not become statistic.
	10789E97	My dearest son,
	04B92356	Tvoja voljena majka.

	1364EFBC	Dear mother, thank you for your e mail. I am always happy to hear from you. Your English is good. Better than mine. I am sorry I have not been much of a good son to you, and that I am not there to take care of you, but you know I cannot come back home. It would bring trouble, and unhappy memories for us both. Roman is well. He is living the American dream, mostly in his head, like all dream.

	84B58346	Life here is the same as it always was. People argue, the farms suffer, we pay taxes for new parliament buildings and government reports, and live in poverty. For country people, life is the same the world. Please write me.
	5A4DCE7E	Your loving mother.
	5929AC2F	In America I imagine the people must be bitter. The world used to love the, now they are despised. This President Lawton seems like a foolish man. Have you met him? Roman said that you and him were up for a prestigious award and you had some powerful friends.
