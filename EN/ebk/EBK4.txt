	6695F569	God, I've got the hangover of the century! Woke up in hospital having no idea what happened to me. I guess that serves me right for having a second helping of my vodka and anti-depressant champagne breakfast martini. I know you're dying for another chance to impress me so come by my place on S in Lancaster by

	7B569EEA	So, you've found the pit of gold at the end of the rainbow. Sifted through all the useless shit and freaks on Craplist to find me. Well, as long as I'm not murdered and thrown in the Humboldt I may as well go on one date with you. The blogosphere can't get enough of hearing date horror stories. You could be the latest craplist monster to make them (and me) scream. Pick me up on S in Lancaster by

	54D351E4	Ummm, hello. WTF. Where were you? I booked my Indonesian dog sitter and didn't even leave Valentino alone. In the end I told her she wasn't getting any money and should walk back across the bridge to Dukes. There are thousands of potential dog sitters on the other side of the Humboldt. Why's she think she's special. Anyway, you should probably fuck her or another one of those outer borough dog sitting fat bitches. That's all you're worth. I'm champagne and you're dogshit!
