	D52095A2	There are bolts from the heavens showering down on Liberty City, to some, static electricity; to others, a display of His anger at the sins of mankind - you decide.
	9CF5A54D	Who says be kind to the environment? It's no friend to us. The fog out there is denser than a jury on a celebrity murder trial, yep, you'll need a powerful, American SUV to cut through this.

	8C05036C	Overcast today, a storm may be blowing, are you prepared? It might be time to get scared and irrational, keep watching Weazel for updates.
	53D81317	It's sunny out there, but blowing a fierce wind, be aware folks, you can almost smell Alderney.
	F6725845	Nothing but a pathetic drizzle out there today, nothing to worry about. When it's time to worry, Weazel will let you know first.
	C23C6FDA	It's raining out there folks, let's hope it washes away some of the liberal garbage and amoral sludge that runs through Liberty City's streets.

	F3B20BC3	Stay in touch, Cousin. I feel as though we are drifting apart. Rom
	BD9B1F8A	Niko, I'm at the gentlemen's club! Check this ass out. Rom
	9DAA8219	Too bad you can't be hanging with me, cuz. Let's do something soon. Rom
	0907366D	Why don't I ever see you, Niko. You spending too much time chasing titties and avoiding your cousin. Let's hang out. Rom
	CCCEBDF1	Niko, you need to get over here. I think your balls must be getting very jealous of mine. Rom
	6F20029D	Niko, I'm on my way to hospital in an ambulance. You ignored my call and they beat me up. They say they're going to get me again.
	E84D74EE	Niko, come see me man. Rom
	1A18D884	Niko, have you heard from your boyfriend yet? Check your email at the TW@ internet cafe. Rom
	C04DC767	Niko! Anytime you need a ride to anywhere give me a call, I'll send one of my drivers to pick you up. Rom
	F8FF38C1	Yo, NB. You left me hanging. Call me next time you can't make it to an appointment. It'll give me time to arrange a date with a hot bored housewife. Rom
	7558B17E	What's the point in owning a car service if you can't give family free rides, call me if you want me to send a driver. Rom
	D1E06A8C	NB. Yellow cabs are too expensive, I don't want you wasting your money. Call me if you want me to send a driver. Rom
	34562F6E	You should have called to cancel, cuz. You probably met a hot woman, yes? Call me soon. Rom
	AFF926B6	Okay, Niko. Are you dead? I don't want to have to call your mother. Let's hang out if you're still breathing. Rom
	E87617AF	Niko, what's going on? Why'd you stand me up? Drug dealing and killing more important than spending time with family? Rom
	5624730A	Thanks for standing me up, Cuz. I met a smoking hot air stewardess while waiting. She felt sorry for me and gave me some first class service. Rom
	A0EDE638	Niko, Remember to check your email. Brucie might have some work for you. We can start rolling with the bling like he does?! Rom
	78BC1735	Shit, Niko. They're going to find out we killed Vlad. I know it. Our bodies are gonna be in the Humboldt next to Vlad's... Shit. Rom
	A530F01E	Niko, remember if you want some money you can call me for a cab job. Rom.
	2C9BFEEA	Niko, you came to Liberty for penthouses, women, fast cars. Don't throw it away for revenge. Darko did not help, remember? Do the deal and maybe we can take a private jet down to Vice City!!
	1BF15D95	Hey Cuz, thanks for saving my ass back there. I thought I'd played my last hand when that biker guy kidnapped me for the Russians. You're a fucking hero, man. Rom
	46D94E66	Niko, I have some more cab work - call me for a job. Rom
	3FA20554	Roman
	958DEBCE	Cuz, thanks for doing this work for Vlad. He's an asshole but I owe him money. What you going to do? Rom
	6DDD9C6E	I needed a lift home from hospital but you didn't pick up. Please tell me you had your face buried in some nice titties at least. Rom
	2241EA42	Niko, I'm getting married tomorrow. Get lots of sleep - I need you to be at the church for 10am. Rom
	1821D602	Niko, I'm at the church. I'm getting married. Wear some smart clothes and get over here as soon as you can. Rom
	D3CB4BEA	My wedding day is here, cuz! Be at the church at 10 o'clock. And wear some smart clothes, I don't want you looking scruffy. Rom
	85992F8F	Niko, I'm getting married at 10 tomorrow morning. My last night as a single man. Go home, get some sleep and meet me at the church. Rom
	CA1839E4	Why did you leave me behind, Cuz? That's not cool. You cut out on me like I was a one night stand. Rom
	DF7E64B0	Niko - come see me at the depot. There is someone I want you to meet. Rom
	FD8320C5	Shit. Need help. Come to the depot quick, man! Rom
	F4DE0F7B	Niko, imagine the honeymoon I can take Mallorie on if you do this deal. Come on, do it for me - I am your cousin. Rom
	875E5589	I'm getting tired of sending all my cars to the airport to pick up 80 year old Vice City residents. Call if you want me to send you one. Rom

	DA9AEB55	If you're not going to show up to our dates, at least tell me what you do with your time. Are you involved with some bad people?
	CCCD4FBA	Well, Niko. I waited for you thinking we had a date. What exactly were you doing instead?
	D97FE91B	Sorry, I'm busy. Speak soon. xx
	CAF64C08	I guess I should expect to be stood up and stuff like that when I'm dating a criminal. That's what you are, isn't it?
	3040169E	Niko, you missed our date. What happened? I hope you haven't got caught up in something. Call me. xx
	7C3CFE89	Michelle
	7610A23E	Umm. I waited for you and you didn't show. Did something else come up. I'd love to know what you do with your time. xx

	90F2E7CE	Why didn't you come to the hospital? Hope you're okay. Rom
	5EA9033B	Had to get one of the drivers to get me back from hospital. Man, that guy don't like doing favours. Try and pick me up next time. Rom
	346DAEC5	NB, you must be real busy with killing at the moment if you can't pick me up from hospital. I'm surprised the ER wasn't full of your victims. Rom
	822BCA40	Got one of the drivers to pick me up from hospital when you didn't show. I think he might get more action than me and Brucie combined. Man is a legend. Rom
	580775F8	I had to get one of the nurses to take me home. I'd be pissed off with you if she hadn't given me a sponge bath with a happy ending. Rom
	25B1914D	I made it home from the hospital by myself. A lot of good you are, cousin. Rom
	FB743CD3	NB, ended up taking the bus back from hospital. Met this Danish backpacker who just arrived in the city. I took her back to her hotel and showed her a side of Liberty she's not going to forget. Rom
	49465876	Thought you would want to know I got home by myself, Cuz. I'm not lying dead in the street. Rom
	F1BE27EB	Cuz, you left me in the club. You go home to bang one of the girls? Have fun, you animal. - Rom
	1AF67A5B	Cuz, if any hot girls call you on this phone looking for a threesome with the one and only Roman Bellic then give them my new number! - Rom
	54F76E5C	Cousin, my other drivers got jealous about you taking all the fares. I've nearly got a mutiny on my hands. You're going to have to earn your money with your fists and not my cabs from now on. Let's hang out. - Rom
	3E58411E	Cuz, where'd you go? Got left in the club by myself. More titties for me, I guess. Later. - Rom
	70B6A75A	Hey man, try not to fall in love with that guy when you go on a date with him. This is business not pleasure. He's probably emailed you by now. - Rom
	BED1C38F	NB - you been on your gay date yet? I know you want to do it! Don't be nervous and check your emails. - Rom
	09D3D816	Shit, where are you? I'm not having this wedding without my cousin the Church is closing soon. Get here! - Rom
	B7723354	Hey cuz, maybe it's all that juice, but Brucie is getting really anxious about you going on that date with French Tom or whatever. You checked your emails? - Rom

	424C8578	~z~~x~If you'd been married for three years you'd realise getting pussy is a very different thing.
	15B32C46	~z~~x~What it matter that I got a wife?
	6E8F5DFD	~z~~x~Course I love her, my friend. She cooks for me and does my laundry.
	33FE68DC	~z~~x~Don't you love her?
	F7A8F032	~z~~x~Take advantage of my generosity and insult me at the same time.
	CC399954	~z~~x~Screw you, shit face. You remind me of my wife, man.
	23F9C8D3	~z~~x~My friend, you are a bitch. I thought you were ever since I first see your ugly-ass face.
	E9F754CF	~z~~x~You got a wife? How about all that women you pick up in the car?
	BDB29027	~z~~x~They'll tell you I service them good.
	63DADC79	~z~~x~You want to know about my customer service, you ask one of my female passengers.
	2B04EACA	~z~~x~It is good for me, real good. I love that shit almost as much as the bitches do.

	D9F3B4C8	~z~~x~You're a charming guy, you know that?
	CAE96ECF	~z~~x~Ever since I got to this city, my friend. Roman's been screwing me ever since I got here - yes.
	E55CA3AD	~z~~x~So, you... you been working for Roman long?
	9E5C95B6	~z~~x~Yeah, whatever. I don't do this crap for the money anyway. I'm just here for the pussy, man.
	58AE0A5A	~z~~x~Hey man, don't talk shit about Roman. If he don't pay fairly, go work for someone else.

	AC1F313B	~z~~x~Yeah? Girls dig this car, do they? Useful to know.

	A04007ED	~z~~x~You didn't think I knew what you were about? I done all kinds of crazy shit.
	0DE8633C	~z~~x~Perhaps you shouldn't go around busting caps in people regardless of your responsibilities.
	039D4EA6	~z~~x~You can't go around busting caps in people when you got responsibilities.
	FE934482	~z~~x~You got a package of snow strapped to your chest?
	19D97B0E	~z~~x~So, am I taking you to a big drug deal or some shit, my friend?
	D4DEF12A	~z~~x~What, you didn't think I was down with that game?
	CC1DDFA8	~z~~x~I don't know what you're talking about.

	CDD8B087	~z~~x~Not free loading like a certain ugly Eastern European immigrant scumbag I know.
	EADBEFFF	~z~~x~I look after Roman, I help him out.
	7AFC1039	~z~~x~I might not work either if I was getting all the money and free rides I wanted from my cousin.

	6B6882EE	~z~~x~You know how much a driver can get paid in this city?
	B77B1B16	~z~~x~You don't like driving me, talk to Roman. He can send one of his other drivers.
	01BD2F99	~z~~x~When I'm driving real fares, that is, not just Roman's stupid cousin.
	98C9DDB0	~z~~x~Because I'm hating every second I have to drive you around for free.

	7D5826CD	~z~~x~You're going to have a heart attack getting so angry the whole time.
	C6ABB977	~z~~x~Yeah, well maybe you should chill out.
	5214B7A7	~z~~x~I am really hoping that Roman realises you are a free loading shit hole so I don't have to drive you again.
	BB14CE04	~z~~x~Roman is doing well, you see this new car, my friend?
	BC5D3A29	~z~~x~I'm not getting paid to lug your ugly ass around and I'm not happy about it, okay, my friend? Get in!

	D57373B9	~z~~x~Hey angry man. You better be going somewhere close, I need to pick up some real fares so I can make real money.
	C728D724	~z~~x~Bring your ugly free riding face into my car very fast, my friend.
	B8EDBAAE	~z~~x~I see you have taken a time out from romancing every animal in the zoo to abuse the generosity of your cousin. Great!
	AB781FC3	~z~~x~Oh hello, you really like taking advantage of Roman's employees, don't you? Dog lover!
	7E19C50B	~z~~x~Hello you free riding dog lover, get in.
	6FE3A89F	~z~~x~Hey craphead, get in the car, my friend.
	619E0C14	~z~~x~Get in my friend. You want me to suck your balls for free because you are Roman's cousin, too?

	3E57B154	~z~~x~I don't want to trouble you, but I would prefer another radio station.
	9024D4F1	~z~~x~Hey man, it'd be cool if we could listen to a different station.

	70FEE207	~z~~x~Shit, homie. I'm starting to get bored of this chopper shit.
	94647251	~z~~x~That was a wild ride, Nicky. Not as wild as the ride you girls are gonna get later, but, yeah - thanks man.
	12F16FCD	~z~~x~You're a real gentleman, Nicky. Big love, baby.

	8B4C1A7A	~z~~x~Get up a bit, baby.
	EB409E4B	~z~~x~Lower, Nicky. These girls want a better view.
	3ED9436F	~z~~x~My arms aren't probably as big as his but fuck it. Hey, head back, Niko.

	E9510DF1	You didn't come to the hospital. That was a funny fucking joke.
	F2D220F3	We should do something, Niko. I want the company of someone who's life's more depressing than mine.
	5143D875	Screw you, Niko. I thought you was coming to the hospital.
	C460C411	Ha ha ha. Tell me you'll pick me up then stay at home. How about I shoot your fucking ear off when I next see ya.
	E5E2870C	Where you at Niko boy? Call me and we'll hang out.
	0026BB94	I got these phone bombs and all I can think is that a sick fuck like you could really have fun with them. Call me.
	BB7C3248	Niko boy, I ain't heard from you in a while. You been iced or sent to the can or something?
	172CE9A8	What you been up to, Niko? Me? I been drinking, fucking, robbing and doing rails. Let's catch up properly.
	9070D67E	Saw this Liberty Tree story about us and them Triads at the Fishmarket when I was looking for some hot amateur shit online. Totally killed my hard-on. Gotta change my homepage.
	3EAEB2FB	Asshole. You better call me when you next need picking up from hospital. I can't wait to tell you no.
	318B98B5	Man, you left me in the strip club. There's far worse places to be abandoned so I'm gonna forgive you. Call me sometime.
	63117BC0	Where did you go, Niko boy? I'm the one who shoulda be suffering from Catholic guilt. Guess you had someone to kill or something. Later.
	66F583D8	Can't believe I wasted my minutes calling an ice cold Slavic killer to ask him if he'd pick me up from hospital.
	9538605D	Eat me, Niko. Funny joke not showing at the hospital.
	8A0B4A03	If I had tits and a nice ass, I bet you woulda picked me up from hospital.
	3C542E96	It was a dumb move calling you earlier. I know you prefer putting people in hospital, not picking them up from there.
	3906638D	Niko - good work last time around, I got some more 'police work' for you. - Francis

	616E2580	~z~Indubitably. But only after we play space volleyball and work up ourselves up a man-sized sweat.
	3E8C7A56	~z~~x~Salads? You don't like salads, ok.
	024401C6	~z~~x~Nine pie and chips a day? It's a start, isn't it?
	3FFEFE42	All diseased pigeons killed. LC is a cleaner place.
	6DF876CE	~z~~x~well you can't eat for an hour before an operation can ya?
	92F140BF	~z~~x~And she went , "It's, it's a dangerous operation, but it's the only option left".
	50ADBC39	~z~~x~One, jogging? Oh you don't even walk. Um...
	83E9850F	~z~~x~They make excuses, don't they, fat people? They say things like...
	CCBB16B1	~z~~x~"Oh... aeroplane seats...
	DE723A1F	~z~~x~They're not big enough for someone like me."
	A25EC1F9	~z~~x~No they're not, because if they were, we'd get twelve fucking people on the plane.
	95DAA8F1	~z~~x~"It's glandular". It's not glandular, it's greed.
	6773CC24	~z~~x~"It's big bones". Yeah, big bones covered in meat and gravy.
	4B059348	~z~~x~Unbelievable, always complain.
	3F36194A	~z~~x~And she was sitting there in hospital, looking all depressed,
	4CA0B503	~z~~x~That'll do it.
	9E9358E7	~z~~x~Ten pie and chips a day, ten separate meals, ten separate trips to the chip shop.
	B053FC68	~z~~x~In a cab, didn't even walk that. Wasted calories.
	69926EE6	~z~~x~Saw a documentary about a woman who was three hundred and fifty pounds,
	3AFF11C0	~z~~x~cause she ate ten pie and chips a day.
	90B0E5F8	Just one flying rat left in Liberty City
	263E6743	~z~~x~So in this documentary they wired her jaw together, to try and stop her eating.
	6B1270EA	~z~~x~that used up ten calories.
	5BB9D251	~z~~x~So, er, they took her to hospital...
	FA820FE3	~z~~x~to give her that operation where they staple your stomach together.
	E93E6A7C	~1~ flying rats left in Liberty City
	F8800BC7	~z~~x~So she liquidized ten pie and chips a day.
	08C8AC58	~z~~x~Pie smoothies. Now she's not even chewing,
	68122753	~z~~x~Could be that. Forty years build up.
	A61E10B5	~z~~x~I actually had to have a medical... uh, for this tour,
	B0EE1E7A	Not good enough, but this stunt jump has been completed before.
	09966A4D	~z~~x~but the truth is - I'm a bit overweight myself.
	FBDFCEE0	~z~~x~No shit!
	765BC3E6	~z~~x~Someone shouted, "No shit".
	F6D8B44C	Not good enough.
	F0FBA65F	~z~~x~"Oh, it's a bit more thorough than usual, you know, it's a big tour.
	1BAAFBBD	~z~~x~We need a urine sample."
	208F059D	~z~~x~I've never had to do that before, so ah...
	D7D3F420	~z~~x~and I've had medicals before for TV work,
	5566EF34	~z~~x~and they just check your pulse, and go, "You're fine".
	3E18C098	~z~~x~But I went along to the doctor, and he said, uh...
	4D60F1E5	~z~~x~to have a go at fat people,
	02507E87	~z~~x~as a guy who's four hundred pounds?
	801CFA1E	~z~~x~We're both allowed thirty-two kilograms on the plane.
	8EF35A2D	Stunt jump completed again.
	B40B6552	~z~~x~"It's not fair." It is fair, you ate too much.
	C34B807E	~z~~x~And if we're talking about fairness, and aeroplanes,
	D4FE23E3	~z~~x~why is it that I get the same luggage allowance
	0E0115E8	~z~~x~I wanna go "No, he used up his thirty-two kilograms on his tits!".
	D06C77FA	~z~~x~Hi, How you doing?
	C07A5816	~z~~x~Cheers, thanks.
	EACB2CB7	~z~~x~I have been known...
	1BC7B175	~z~~x~Thanks very much, goodnight. Enjoy your meals.
	297BCCDD	~z~~x~Not you, you've had enough.
	9626836F	~z~~x~Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ricky Gervais!
	0B01F371	~z~Smack.
	E1339FD5	~z~Ow.
	17778C5C	~z~Smack
	EE1C39A6	~z~And he's flailing... just missin'. And you'll just steadily kick him in the bollocks.
	B448C600	~z~Ow.
	46C5CDDE	With these plates, you won't be recognized.
	25A228B1	~z~People go, "Ooh, you must never go at midgets."
	431764CF	~z~Thanks very much!
	5439071A	~z~Good night!
	35C1242C	~z~~x~And now, Mr. Ricky Gervais!
	17708C4A	~z~Why not? What are they gonna do?
	25DF2927	~z~You must never go at fundamentalist terrorists. They're the scary ones.
	3CDF585F	~z~Midgets? Do what you want.
	97D60D1B	~z~It's the war equivalent of holding a midget at arm's length. Like that.
	AAB8AD58	~z~Go and kill him.
	990A09FB	~z~Falklands War. That's probably my favorite.
	AAC9AD76	~z~People say that was a conflict.
	EA1A2B0E	~z~Yea! Good. Yea!
	0628E433	~z~Aw, thank you Mr. Pot. Yea.
	F3B8BF53	~z~No, I-I'm thick, as you can see. I'm-I'm thi - him, over there. Look.
	98F309C9	~z~It was a war.
	65D180FE	As good as new.
	61AD9B3F	~z~So we just parked our boats about 10 km away, and theirs were falling into the water.
	C1C060EF	~z~While... we were shelling the shit out of them.
	CFD6778F	~z~And it's my favorite, 'cause it was a range war.
	BD18D214	~z~And what that means... is that...the Argentinean guns could fire 9 km...
	7475C0CF	~z~Whereas the British guns could fire 17 km....
	EA89F23B	~z~~x~I went "What's the disease?".
	DAD652D4	~z~~x~She went "Everything tastes good".
	9EC82C80	They're not going to respray THAT.
	91D0C0C2	~z~~x~No it's not, you just like eating, don't you?"
	CF4E3BC4	~z~~x~How is that a disease?
	BD4317AE	~z~~x~"Oh I'm so fucking ill..." num, num, "Oh I'm well ill".
	F8278D76	~z~~x~Everything?
	05E5278D	~z~~x~people coming up to him in bandages, going "Jesus my flesh is falling off"?
	7F586D9D	Come back when you've got the cash.
	58ABCD19	~z~~x~And he goes "I cant stop now - there's a fat woman over there on her third pie".
	1564C68C	~z~~x~"Not salads".
	2737EA32	~z~~x~That's not a disease, leprosy is a disease.
	F3498256	~z~~x~Can you imagine Jesus in the Temple,
	A665E9EC	~z~~x~I went, "No it's not, is it?
	92955DD7	~z~~x~but in all honesty, I think that some causes are more worthy than others.
	9BD47055	~z~~x~Obviously cancer is a very worthy cause, AIDS is a very worthy cause,
	2E1914E0	~z~~x~but I got asked to do a benefit gig recently for sufferers of obesity.
	4792C7CF	~z~~x~Whoah. Thank you. Hi, wow thank you very much.
	6153FB51	~z~~x~What a lovely welcome.
	80DABA62	~z~~x~As you know I do a lot of charity work,
	B9582B5C	~z~~x~What? Sufferers of obesity.
	5AD1D2C5	~z~~x~"No because obe...", she was eating.
	FE84BD59	This one is on the house.
	782C0D79	~z~~x~So she went, "Obesity is a disease".
	6893C014	They won't be looking for this color.
	C3C64038	~z~~x~I said "You mean fat people?",
	6C937648	~z~~x~she went, "No because obes...". Well, she actually went,
	4A4058FF	~z~~x~you know, I went to the toilet, filled up this little bottle he gave me, good as gold.
	E9D53B7B	~z~~x~Mr. Ricky Gervais!
	FBDDDF8C	~z~~x~Whoa, ah, thank you.
	553C924C	~z~~x~Yeah it really is me.
	2F0DA85A	~z~~x~"IPodge".
	213B0CB5	~z~~x~Cheeky bastards.
	5270EF20	~z~~x~Thanks very much, good night!
	64A23117	~z~~x~Calm down.
	56249424	~z~~x~it's a pain, ain't it?
	C453F081	~z~~x~Nothing in it for me.
	EBE5902D	~z~~x~Do a lot of work for, um, cancer.
	AED74580	~z~~x~I do a lot of work for charity.
	C036683E	~z~~x~I don't do enough; they say you can always do more.
	69A93B2D	~z~~x~But I look at it like this,
	F050A965	~z~~x~Full page in the paper the next day. With a headline...
	6ED3A5A5	~z~~x~Why bring that into it?
	D11BEAFC	~z~~x~"Ricky Gervais, Rotund Comedian."
	5E490558	~z~~x~Rotund?!!!
	17C37782	~z~~x~and the papers, they need an adjective.
	05C0D37D	~z~~x~They can't just say, "Ricky Gervais, Comedian".
	807CC8F7	~z~~x~They say things like, "Ricky Gervais, Tubby Comedian".
	EAD61E74	~z~~x~That sounds like a giant fucking wombat! I'm not rotund!
	371536ED	~z~~x~listening to some... sounds on my MP3 player.
	44D2D268	~z~~x~"Oh yeah, looking good."
	E2920DE8	~z~~x~Paparazzi got me.
	F910BAE9	~z~~x~One called me a Chubby Funster!
	0733D72F	~z~~x~That's a gay porn name!
	158573D2	~z~~x~I was jogging once,
	09D3C691	~z~~x~And I was doing the gig, and he was laughing along, and I was thinking,
	37B8A25A	~z~~x~"Yeah, you laugh it up mate", I was fuming.
	84FD372E	~z~~x~And eventually it got too much for me.
	978F620E	~z~~x~He was telling me about his illness and he said he was eighteen.
	4E52CF92	~z~~x~And that was then, that was two years ago, so now he must be twenty -
	7C32AB55	~z~~x~so how the fuck is he still a teenager?
	733F93B3	~z~~x~And I went, "Alright mate, I recognize you... ".
	13B2D467	~z~~x~He went "Yeah". I said, "Get out!".
	4F454B8B	~z~~x~And I called security.
	6132EF66	~z~~x~And they came, and he struggled, but he was weak.
	8FB5CC9F	~z~~x~I went, "'ello, yeah, you came backstage two years ago?".
	BD7BA82A	~z~~x~He went "Yeah",
	41C8B092	~z~~x~I said "You said you were eighteen then?", he went "Yeah... ", "So you're twenty now?".
	69F686DD	~z~~x~And I thought, oh yeah, he came back stage two years ago.
	4573434B	~z~~x~But I will say this, if I ever get cancer myself,
	5B316EC7	~z~~x~I'm going to walk into the nearest hospital and go right; I paid for that machine,
	A2457CEE	~z~~x~get that little bald fucker off it.
	0227BCB1	~z~~x~That's my chosen charity.
	4851C904	~z~~x~Do a lot of work for people with cancer.
	5F0CF67A	~z~~x~And they're welcome to it.
	2FDB181B	~z~~x~Talking of um, little bald fuckers, I did the teenage cancer gig last year. What?
	DF04F0F8	~z~~x~It's a great gig though, the kids with cancer get in for free, and you meet them afterwards, and...
	954A5D84	~z~~x~you know, they come backstage and you sign stuff for them, and...
	C31A3923	~z~~x~I was doing the gig, this last year, and I looked down and I recognized one of them.
	7EB6B5D1	~z~~x~No I done it, two years before, but they called again last year.
	8C785154	~z~~x~"We're still ill...".
	DBD26A93	~z~~x~You lasted.
	54D06EFF	~z~~x~Well, why didn't he warn me?

	1B5FA97D	~z~Drive in - take out. Burger Shot! Die with a smile on your face.
	6CDDA5F5	~z~It's back. The groundbreaking formulaic cliffhanger, 72. Can Judd Parker save the world from terrorists
	999BFF71	~z~by staying up for three days and torturing every person of color he can find? I hope so.
	D9E92691	~z~The Heart Stopper! The all new tower of a meal at Burger Shot. It's the 6lb burger you can't live without!
	A98145C2	~z~The Heart Stopper. Seven patties. Six pounds of meat and cheese - you'll be flatlined in five seconds flat!
	B74FE15F	~z~Mmmm. This is a fucking good burger.
	88595CEC	~z~The cliffhanger begins soon - only on Weazel.
	020F3928	~z~Yeah hi, this is Mike from Cleveland.
	8A01C90F	~z~What's up, Mike?
	9C726DF0	~z~I tell you what, Bas. My boy Jeff, he is your number one fan. He's in the joint right now but he'll be out in a couple of years.
	52945A31	~z~And now... we're back in the place where your Mom's phone number is scrawled in the stall!
	655AFFBE	~z~The Men's Room with Bas and Jeremy!
	F028155A	~z~Ok, we're back from commercials. Man, that felt like forever. Who's on line three?
	D4381B2F	~z~Are you calling from Burger Shot?
	6950F823	~z~Just like that. You see, it works with him, works for you. You know, you walk down the street all nice,
	3C121DA6	~z~and looky look what do we have here? Oooo, it's a lamp post. Oooo, this is your head. BOOM BOOM BOOM.
	45DB3138	~z~I smash the lamppost against it. You like that? Do you see me now? Huh? Do you see me now?
	1F1D63BD	~z~I was walking...talking to a friend of mine on the phone. Long time ago.
	F0D3872A	~z~He was telling me how he lacked the respect and attention from the fellow school teachers in school. What do you do?
	598B5898	~z~If you don't get respect? Okay, so I told him, the way you get a man's attention is by doing the unexpected. BOOM.
	9296CAAE	~z~OK, I think now in his teachers' lounge, trust me, those people there they know he's around.
	E0A95E9E	~z~We'll be back in The Men's Room. Remember; don't tap your foot under the stall.
	8269F790	~z~911, what is your emergency?
	50241305	~z~Aaagh, I think my heart stopped!! The left side of my face has gone numb.
	A4B1EEE4	~z~Nobody will ignore him any more. And if a woman walks by, the only thing you need to do is whip it out and say -
	25F5E936	~z~what are we gonna do about this? I'm telling you, people cower under their desks when he's nearby. Man, it's much better.
	0AA4B294	~z~Yeah... charmed, I'm sure. Hey Bas, I think we need to take a commercial break.
	3F5716D2	~z~Is cybersex cheating? Like, I've got a video camera up to my business and I'm in a chat room all lubed up.
	4EA5B56F	~z~But that doesn't hurt anyone. But my wife - she's divorcing me!
	9BCC4FBB	~z~I tell you, I hate the Internets. It's for cats and pedophiles and it's for girly men who want to trick Bas.
	1700463D	~z~I'm on a construction motif right now. Okay, let's go to the phones.
	5FF8D815	~z~So, who's on line five?
	723A7C98	~z~Hey man, my name is Jack. I'm a big fan of the show since you came back on the air. I have a question.
	AD017225	~z~And let me tell you. It's not like real life.
	656A7194	~z~What good is virtual reality if you can't maim people? It's bullshit. You know what this is Jeremy?
	FAD39C60	~z~What?
	0C3D3F33	~z~What's this? What's this?
	96B6C5AC	~z~I love my-online-me.com. You know, you can really get in touch with yourself by building a little virtual character
	A948EAD0	~z~and building him a house and making him go to the bathroom and watching him sleep.
	5755D56B	~z~You know what - I hate it. That's what I do. I walked up to the people in virtual reality and I can't break their legs.
	053DA2B8	~z~and then I cut off your arm. Just like this. And I start hitting with the wet part of the arm.
	D48E4D86	~z~Thanks Mike. And thanks Jeff. Now, a lot of people in the joint should learn from my advice.
	E8FE7666	~z~You are the boss or you are the bitch. That is the name of my next book. I don't believe in an eye for an eye.
	700B0481	~z~Oh no. Because Bas believes in an eye for two eyes, or better yet, an eye for two eyes, and an ear,
	259D8044	~z~Man, you really put a lot of great advice in your show.
	37EB24DF	~z~Thank you. Thank you.
	E5797FFD	~z~I mean, put yourself first or people will put you second. I mean, history has some great examples of that.
	7E61A12E	~z~and a spleen and maybe a new shirt because this one is covered in entrails. YEAH!!!
	9DAB5FC5	~z~Bas - you sound REALLY constipated. You know, I had a colon cleansing. It was really fantastic.
	68DCF629	~z~Man, I had so much fecal matter impacted inside me, it was such a drag.
	38091482	~z~I tell you what Bas says will clean you right out - a nail gun. Bam bam bam, and then I grab a circular saw,
	A9F6F85C	~z~Who wants to knife fight with me in the audience? Who wants to knife fight with me in the audience?
	8044A4F8	~z~Bas! Bas! BAS!
	4721B2B3	~z~Cowards!

	55724D5E	~z~No, Bas, no. That's not nice.
	86402EF9	~z~Hey listen. We all hated to be ignored, right? Some people try yoga or putting neon under their car - whatever that does -

	3BF19EDD	~z~living in an oily mosquito filled swamp full of industrial wastelands and soccer moms. But things wouldn't be quiet for long.
	73350D63	~z~Soon the colony expanded and areas were named after heavily inbred members of their Germanic royal family.
	E15369A6	~z~Broker was named after Sir William Broker III - the King's bastard son who was conceived by a milk maid.

	7CBA9F0E	~z~It was a war agitated for by a number of musket companies, who knew they would win, whatever the outcome.
	2F5B05AC	~z~Americans felt, and rightly so, that they shouldn't have to pay any taxes.
	9F9D662F	~z~Let the market sort it out. Poor people will die, rich people will win. Welcome to progress.

	D9D15D46	~z~Diversity was troubling, and with diversity comes chaos, as we know to our peril today.
	58C6DB2F	~z~Nietzsche said that, and he was so clever he ended up in a lunatic asylum.
	2E5E865F	~z~Then leaders began to fear the worst.
	EAA37DA2	~z~It's always been a great nation. What? I'm not racist!
	345C9113	~z~The English quickly renamed New Rotterdam 'Liberty City' after a generous donation by The Bank of Liberty

	781D7950	~z~gold teeth, and golden toilet seats. The union jack was taken down in Liberty City, replaced with the stars and stripes,
	1EF5C6FE	~z~and the newly liberated Americans celebrated. Soon this entrepreneurial spirit took hold, and Liberty City was unstoppable.
	0C5921C5	~z~Although they were free the people lived in squalor. You could buy a young boy on the streets for a few pence.

	EE48E601	~z~Whatever... we saved their asses in WW2. Get me some freedom fries.
	0A4A1DA7	~z~The Revolutionary war quickly ended. Residents pulled down the statue of king George and melted it into gold chains,
	AFB86885	~z~It was a great time to be in the top 5% of the population.
	90472853	~z~righteous women were forced to spend time under the train tracks, servicing men for three pence.
	A290CCE6	~z~You could get your knob slobbed for less than the price of a donut. It was a nation on the up. T
	EB9BDEFB	~z~he politicians were having a field day - you couldn't get them to vote because they were all out having their knobs slobbed.
	9E13453B	~z~It was a great time, to be white. Yes, but soon meddlers like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson came in
	22654C8D	~z~to change the successful agrarian based slave economy to one of excessive service fees for concert tickets and huge turnpike tolls.
	35A87313	~z~With slavery soon outlawed in Liberty City and the other northern colonies,
	FD4CE58E	Service Pack:
	64616E5C	~z~Oh, yes lots of those. Strong ones, you take with young coeds when discussing their thesis,
	2DCF0138	~z~and then begin to rub their thighs while they say "Didn't I hear you on that documentary?'
	40E6A767	~z~and you whisper to them until they pass out, but I digress...
	8B7D3C93	~z~And of course you can still see that rich tradition today - Americans don't want health care or education.
	D552D045	~z~No, no, we want guns and fireworks shows and wars so politicians can invest in armament companies and clean up.
	E7CC7538	~z~And of course we want drugs.
	AB1E7BD5	~z~The American Revolution was bloody. Soon the French joined in the war to help the struggling American insurgency.

	E229A103	~z~in an orgiastic fury of self important nonsense, although the exact nature of the differences escape me just at this moment,
	865CE963	~z~but regardless, Liberty City gave the white settlers plenty of time to focus on the important things, like getting laid.
	56C30A30	~z~The slave craze was huge! It was like waiting for a new IFruit phone to come out...
	FE55CEFB	~z~like yelling at their women for buying too much shit in the strip mall.
	088BE367	~z~The new economy was a boom.
	D8268CFD	~z~It was very different to failed Jamestown, where a bunch of incest-loving cannibals consumed each other
	A1011EAB	~z~People would line up at the docks and wait in line for days to own their very own person
	032CE2C9	~z~That year all the local indigenous tribes were brought together and paid for what would be the greatest real estate
	F29B41A6	~z~deal in the history of the world. 14,000 acres of prime downzone real estate for some spare change,
	B7574C37	~z~a porno magazine and front row tickets for a game of cricket.
	AB363315	~z~and then put them online for a higher price.
	2488257F	~z~Some dissenters wandered if about the moral consequences on a nation founded on genocide, slavery and theft,
	4E0A7883	~z~but they were quickly imprisoned as being unpatriotic by proto-chickenhawks. Of course we have very different values now.
	C4DADC02	~z~newly free from the tyranny of Europe time to focus on important things in life,
	ABEE2941	~z~roller coasters, and the entertainment of a nightly hanging at the gallows,
	F6313DCA	~z~all the things civilization had brought to bear on this land.
	DF7C1060	~z~All of Europe wanted to come see what freedom was really like.
	992E03C1	~z~I mean, I mean, the shitty maps.
	8A62662A	~z~The other reason was savages!
	BCA0CAA6	~z~Advertisements were sent back to Europe promising settlers a new life in a new city that had 24-hour convenience stores,
	AF41B0CC	~z~When they arrived, they were aghast at America's new pastime - watching animals fuck, and betting on it.
	CF29F0A0	~z~thought by some to mean "place for condo skyscraper", and by others as "island to catch an STD."
	A0FC1445	~z~In 1625, right after the colony was founded,
	DA980780	~z~the first ship of slaves arrived to give the hard working morally upstanding non-hypocritical Americans,
	8117D479	~z~Yes, well, This truly was the city of the future.
	D3E57A13	~z~And as word spread, so did the settlement.

	9547CB38	~z~Another thing worth bearing in mind is that in the spring of 1647 the East India Trading Company hired a cross-dressing

	21C2642F	~z~while preaching the good word to some savages by blowing them up with a cannon which backfired.
	C78FB82F	~z~It wasn't well received, the city was burned to the ground.
	7FFA2995	~z~Within a few years New Rotterdam had become so diverse that the Dutch had become a minority in their own colony -
	75441429	~z~then, just like today, nobody paid attention to the Dutch and only passed through to get stoned and screw a hooker,
	01CCACA8	~z~Puritanical and self-righteous, he had orders to return civility and productivity to the colony.
	240CF128	~z~Within weeks, he had banned drinking, smoking, fornicating with Indians, Texas hold-'em, missing church, anal beads,
	B76E97ED	~z~laughter, and imposed strict fines for male camel toe and whistling in public.

	5A1B91C1	~z~It hadn't worked for the Greeks and it wouldn't work for the Dutch.
	93BF8508	~z~ 4,000 miles from home and no internet connection to read up on soccer scores, the populace became disenchanted.
	C51967BB	~z~Cricket is the most boring game ever. What do the British know about sports? They're all gay.
	D6868A9D	~z~The Dutch had a land of plenty, they traded beaver skins, a 17th century version of wife swapping,
	E8402E10	~z~and partied late into the night.
	7D88589A	~z~And the colonies deep seeded racism and love of 24 hour shopping would begin to prove it's undoing.
	A9AD73AB	~z~And the campaign to clean up Liberty City and shut down the cumatoriums began almost as soon as the city was founded.
	689BF1E1	~z~What most people don't know, but what I discovered through extensive reenactments, purely for research of course,
	8819341E	Toggle Hotkeys
	704480DA	~z~Liberty City, a town on the edge, a town at the daybreak of dawn, a city at the gate of the universe,

	9B6AD726	~z~The gateway to the new world was also a terrifying den of inequity.
