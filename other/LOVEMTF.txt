	A0701858	I'm looking for a guy who can see past my physical assets, which I know won't be easy. I just want to get close to another person without any kind of lubricant being involved, I've been around the pole and back again and now I'm ready for love.
	A02D83F0	Carmen likes looking good. She work hard at her appearance - it weren't cheap to get this ass or these teeth. She's been spending money on herself for you, so you should spend the money on her when you going out. She likes all men as long as they treat her like a princess. She don't mind getting her fingers greasy at Cluckin' Bell or watching greased up girls at the strip club.
	A443497D	34
	A1405A51	Girly girls.
	9A29BFFC	Bohan
	9A16C565	Dog people. Listening to the kids in my ward tell me boring stories about their imaginary friends, or their stupid toys or about how they're going to heaven and they'll see me again - yeah, right - not if I see you first kiddo!
	9FDB57E3	Anything cheap.
	9B017994	I like things that challenge me mentally, the harder the better. On the weekend I like taking off my PVC underwear and just relaxing, away from any crude euphemisms. I also enjoy gardening, I just find that getting down on my knees and really going at it til I'm all dirty and sweaty is so satisfying.

	84F159DD	Straight
	8ADC26F0	I don't like how you can't get free refills anywhere in the mall anymore, I mean, I have to walk all the way back down to Burger Shot? Jeez. And I hate it when the A/C gives out in my mom's car and it smells like Pickles, her dog.
	89D76DB3	Systems analyst
	82B2C8FB	Hot cars, hot bars, the best restaurants and a great man to share them with. I like to be respected and treated like the goddess I am. I like it when a man gives a present and doesn't expect anything in return. I like it when heads turn and your wallet comes out.
	7C6410F5	Men who are cheap or drive in old men cars and dress too serious.
	83DAAC6A	Athletic
	82F39190	Broker
	8D1ADDC7	I used to enjoy ****** and ***** but now since I moved to ***** they don't have any ******* and I mostly have to ***** **** **** with my ******. So if that sounds good to you, then get in touch and maybe we can find something to not talk about together.
	97598E8B	I like having some buddies over to watch The Science of Crime, we meet every week and turn it into a drinking game. You have to drink every time Shory takes his sunglasses off, delivers a line looking moody, runs his fingers through his hair, swim-walks, or gets thrown off a case. Usually nobody remembers the end of the episode as we are all blacked out from alcohol poisoning at that point. We call ourselves the SoCs!
	968DFD16	Free Spirit
	98D8F547	Hard work and hard play. The outdoors: softball in the park, basketball, golf. Hitting the beach. A man who doesn't get intimidated by a woman who knows what she wants (and how to get it) in the workplace and the bedroom.
	97A55C6F	Pediatric Nurse

	EB5D2E31	At the moment, Carmen is a nurse. But she's so much more special than that. She going to be an actress or a model or some shit. Definitely a celebrity. Who knows how it's going to happen, but Carmen's gonna be big time. If you a hot chico then Carmen the girl for you.
	E2068B67	Any size of heart can break.
	E1BD7E49	Undercover Lover
	E63C5DB7	Girly girls. Anyone who takes themselves too seriously and doesn't like having fun. People who won't knock it back when the whole bar is shouting SKULL IT at them. People who think that a woman who parties with guys, dresses like a guy, and drinks straight from the keg isn't feminine.
	E257F1D7	Recruiter
	F0F5ED93	Algonquin
	FD8EBEB1	Going out to bars, getting messed up. Playing pool and bowling. Beer pong. Frat houses. Pick up trucks and 4x4's. Football teams and rolling round on baseball diamonds. Pool parties and long weekends in Cancun.

	FDE813A3	Creep lawyers who try to hit on me and get my clients sent away.
	F61F43B5	I've worked hard to get where I am and don't have time to mess around. When I'm in the office I like to get my head down and to squeeze the most possible out of every moment. When I'm out and having fun, I like to do the same. I believe that, like anything in life, a relationship gets better as you work at it.
	F3388AFC	Accommodating
	FC6A9104	People who are suspicious of my motives.
	F9C404C2	Carmen don't like to be controlled so don't you try to tie her down. When she was a little girl her Daddy was the only man in her life, now that she's a big girl Carmen has all the men she likes. She don't like stuck up places or stuck up people tho.
	E190E7AD	I haven't met a pole I couldn't handle
	C03AB9A6	I was lonely, but now I get to sleep with a different man every night of the week

	C275FCF3	Hot cars. Hot bars.
	B5C1772B	Undisclosed
	B44AAC2A	The green energy movement. Rights for the disadvantaged. Sunsets. Chocolate. Delivering soup to the homeless. The needy. Commitment. Love. Completeness. Organic food. Free trade coffee.

	CF4A4320	Slim
	CDFCD526	I'm more than a 36DD
	28AD3ABB	When some troll comes up behind you and steals the magical key before you can use it to unlock the vault of wisdom on level six - that really sucks. I dislike people who make negative assumptions about me simply because I like to pretend I'm a ghost-elf-princess on weekends.
	26FDAF60	38
	2CF751F8	Going outside, answering the phone, being able to talk to my family.
	2B8DA717	I prefer cuddling
	208B420F	32
	20589823	My love-life has really gone down-hill since I entered the Witness Protection Program, I thought it might be fun at first, you know, like an episode of '72' or something...but it's really kinda dull.
	24118BB6	I like mature men who don't get along with their kids. I like people who'll just look at my chest and not ask any questions. I also like heart conditions, Alzheimer's and wheelchairs with shoddy brakes.
	2136DA40	Dying kids and how they're so needy.
	2DDE451D	People who say stuff like, 'Smile, it might never happen!' or 'Jesus loves you.' or some shit. People who take pictures of their cats to put on the internet, man I'd like to get my hands on one of them. I dislike it when you get a guy's name tattooed on your ass and then he decides to move back in with his ex.
	3EB6F577	My little kitties, they are so fucking cute!
	3DCBCB93	Straight
	3F915694	I'm really fun and friendly! And I'm open-minded too; I work right next to a gay guy. I work for a health insurance company, which is really, like, rewarding because I feel like I've helped people to get better, people who can afford to.
	3F4C7F91	22
	327D89AD	Huggable
	326C7CAB	Secrets, aliases, disguises, remembering fake names.
	3C0E4B74	Love is suicide
	331E3DAE	I have three adorable cats called Tiddles, Riddles and Piddles (Piddles has some bladder control problems that are like, not his fault). My favorite hobby is to take a day off and take totally funny pictures of the little sweetums to post on my blog. I'm looking for a guy who likes cats.
	1EFFCF39	Anything cheap. The mentality that spending less gets you more. People who don't respect a woman and her right to be looked after. Men who don't think that every moment a woman spends with him is a gift that should be celebrated and cherished.
	0B6B8EE1	I like hanging out, I like going places and I really like staying home.
	0752C7D1	I really like stuff
	0EF0B5B4	I don't really like war, or hatred, or people who are mean
	0D422BBE	How much I've been given. I've had such a privileged life; I've been given so much that I feel guilty. I just want to give something back. I try to do that with my job and my charities. I hate conspicuous consumption and all that yuppie-scumbag shit. The three strikes law. Judges who don't give unlucky defendants a break. Republicans. Cheaters. Liars. Hypocrites. Etc. Etc. Etc.
	04F42E73	Best body you ever going to see.
	04E6C49B	Lickingood
	06C49930	DUKES
	06ABE4CE	I know what I'm worth. I won't have no man try to get me cheap 'cause that would be wrong for him and wrong for me. If you get an amazing car cheap then you won't love it as much. You have to work to keep me. If you do that you'll get a beautiful woman who has class and likes a good time.

	6B4AAE0A	SBF looking for LTR. I'm a career woman. I'm married to my job and looking after my clients so I need a man who doesn't mind coming second to that. That's not saying that I wouldn't be dedicated to a relationship. I've got so much love to give. Sometimes I just feel like I'm bursting I've got so much to give. Looking for friendship... for fun... for forever...
	69D0D499	27
	716D9C09	LoveMeet lets me bypass awkward drinks to take an express route to bed.

	72073409	Straight
	78A3827F	I don't like being taken the wrong way. I hate how people just assume everything I do is about sex. I want people to think about what goes on inside me and not what I do for a living.
	78881E35	Job?
	79D5FEBD	Alderney
	78D91227	Could you be my fantasy?
	77627FF9	When guys from the FIB promise you that something will be just like being in a sexy Vinewood spy movie where tons of guys will want to hook up with you, and then it turns out that it blows.

	41BD470D	I like cats, duh! I like drawing three little paw prints on greetings cards so it looks like they signed it too! I like dressing them up as the founding fathers and having our own little purrfect thanksgiving dinner. I like really violent sex.
	40C112BB	Time wasting. Waiting to be served food when you can order it over the counter. People making themselves stupid with drugs and alcohol so they don't enjoy experience.
	44A550A3	Put it this way, I know a hell of a lot about computers.
	44372D20	Perfect
	524A398B	I'm looking for a guy who is into the same stuff, like collecting really disturbing figurines from weird cartoons. I hate it when guys are all like, happy and stuff, trying to put a good spin on things, it's like, 'dude, cut it out with that shit, you're gonna give me diabetes'.
	5B93B81F	23
