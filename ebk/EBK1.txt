	94C6200D	I found it in a car park, of all places. Head to Cerveza Heights and pick it up.
	99F73617	Brucie has forgotten about that last fuck up, bro. Just thought I should clear the air.
	9367A9D0	I know you didn't want to help me out on the last one, but you're a fucking winner. You won't pussy out every time.
	8BCC8F96	Brucie thought you rolled like a fucking prince last time around. ALL GOOD!
	92A8A86E	Brucie don't mind you pussying out of the last request. Even winners like us need to take some time out from making $$$ to work on our abs.
	A6AFC3BC	Someone's taking it for a spin around the South Slopes area. Don't fuck the suspension on those cobbles, Dude. Steal it, take it to East Hook Bay and keep a lookout for Liberty City's finest.
	A800D8EB	It's done. -N
	A2533C87	BTW - that last one you got me. You rule. You are genetically superior! That's how you roll.
	9AEF2DDB	I felt the vibes off that last bitch, bro. You rule!
	9B3DACD8	Some pimp / pusher must've stolen that shit first coz it's outside a project on Chase fucking Point. Hook me up with that shit. Leave it in my East Hook Bay lockup.
	76786F1A	We're all cool on the fuck up before. Brucie don't bear no grudges and shit.
	79F8C342	NB, the main man,
	7232FBA3	It's yours. -N
	6F23E165	We all cool about you not going for the last order. Just send me a pic of the bitch you were boning instead of helping me out.
	71A74BDE	The car is yours. -N
	89DF0A1B	It's parked at the docks in BOABO. Hope someone wasn't planning on shipping that shit coz it's not going anywhere. Get a fellow alpha those wheels and he'll be real happy. Drop it in my storage bay in East Hook.
	8BC919BB	It's all good on that last fuck up BTW. I can't expect you to be as perfect as my deltoids.
	88941A0A	There is other shit for me to be doing right now. Sorry. -N
	7D89B053	Send a reply my way and get me the wheels. There's a lot of $$$ in it 4 u. Be the top dog, bro.
	84D00CBD	All cool on you not being able to help me out with the last one. You were probably screwing some hot bitch. You're that fucking ALPHA!
	AB1C4CB9	Look out for it being driven round Meadows Park by some beta or gamma or some shit.
	E6C88C82	I don't got the time, man. Sorry. -N
	E76EC6DD	Bro, that last shit was nothing short of fucking superior.

	EB868C3F	Reply and you can get me the new wheels. Be genetically superior, bro.
	EE3CC074	There's this sweet Sabre GT.
	BA38EAF2	It's parked by in front of the station in Meadow Hills and that shit looks locked up real tight.
	BD81FD2C	Man, all cool on not getting the last one. Even an Alpha male like you has to fuck up sometimes.
	B897266D	If you're alpha enough reply to this email and get the ride for me. CU
	AC1B5033	When I opended the lockup and saw that last bitch I nearly fucking cried, bro. It was beautiful.
	B4E2CDC1	At the moment Brucie is really vibing this Feltzer.
	D507220E	That was some tight shit on the last one, bro.

	11F57B39	I hate to disappoint but I got other things on my plate. -N
	00AEF7BD	It's down some alley in Schottler with some whacked out dealers.
	086345F8	Once you've replied to this email go and get this bitch for me. Stay Alpha,

	1BF31BD8	There's a Sanchez that makes my balls tingle.
	3AD8EDAC	Smooth moves on that last one, by the way. You are genetically superior.
	616645EA	It ain't a big deal about you being too pussy to get me the last order. You just didn't have the balls. Not that I think you don't got big balls. Both you and me can have big balls. Don't start thining my balls ain't big, ok????
	6339BCD1	It's at a carwash in Beechwood City. If a man found that shit in his lockup he'd be real happy.
	5F260D9D	Niko, how you rolling?
	575E174C	There are other things I must be doing. I'm sorry. -N
	5CFFBC25	Bro, not coming thru on the last one is behind us. Ok? Water under the bridge, bro.
	68D320F7	NiKo, man, Wassup winner?
	6D62D123	BTW it's parked near a playground in Firefly Projects. Go get it for me and put it in the lockup in East Hook Bay.
	684552B4	Brucie's can't remember shit about the screw up earlier, bro. He's a fucking amnesiac. Yeah?
	63775E2C	I want to help you out but cannot now. Sorry. -N

	42EEFDDC	Need to send out some mad props for the last job BTW. Alpha, bro. ALPHA!
	44B18B8D	Brucie can't stay angry at a fellow alpha male. That's why he's not going to say shit about the last fuck up.

	4D02C7D6	I'll get it. -N
	4DBA9E93	Roman told me you was good for this shit. He told me you were fucking alpha and gonna fucking rule the world and you could handle yourself. I believe that shit. YOU'RE THE FUCKING MAN! Do this for Brucie.
