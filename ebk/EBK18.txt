	CAAC54C7	Nice to hear from you, Hossan. I stayed. Let me know when you are back in town.
	CBB99C28	Hey man,
	C650B832	Your friend,
	84CEB52F	Your friend,
	C251AC15	Yeah, I'm tangled up in it and I don't think there's a way to get out. We'll see. Look after yourself. - N
	D4384FE2	Thank you, Hossan. Things are not great. Trouble has followed me here from Europe and life has become cheap. I do not wish to involve you in this mess. Take care, Niko.
	E899FCC4	Your friend,
	EC3183F7	Your friend,
	DBEDF74A	I'm still here Hossan, but I found out my cousin's stories were just stories. Getting by ain't easy. - N

	08EC168C	Hey man,
	39935606	Anyway, I jumped ship and I'm around. I'm just down in Florida, but I'm back soon. Hopefully bump into you. I might get job selling fake handbags in Suffolk. There's a lot of money to be made there. It's crazy!
	650CCECC	Hey man,
	67D93291	How you doing? Did you decide to stay in Liberty City? How's your cousin? I stayed. I heard everyone did. Did you hear about poor Captain. Poor man. He turned up dead and drunk in the river. And everyone else jumped ship? I wonder what those Chinese guys did with that heroin they were supposedly smuggling?
	4C7D7BDA	Good seeing you, Niko! Try to stay out of trouble. You seemed kind of worn out. I hope things are not serious. I keep haring about the Eastern European crime wave and I hope you are not tangled up in this mess. Let me know if I can help.
	3FC00433	Hey man,
	490C3DAB	Take care,
