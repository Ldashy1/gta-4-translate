	12B77D6C	Just saw you were interested in yours truly. Get in line. To be honest, my inbox has been filling up every ten seconds since I put up the ad. I was just sending out a load of rejections when I saw you, and you don't look like the other guys.

	5BE50FBE	I had no idea how many poor and ugly people there were in LC before I started this internet dating thing. It's yuk! Should have stuck to picking up closeted politicians at Hercules. At least then you can squeeze a few g outta em while getting satisfied. Anyway, you're the best of a bad bunch on this site so I can forgive what you did before. Come by the 69th Street Diner with your wallet and maybe I'll forget about how you just wasted my time.
