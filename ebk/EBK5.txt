	FD2DBFD5	Ouch. I'm not feeling so good today. What happened was totally my fault. I definitely don't balme you. You're just a product of your environment and the way that society treats immigrants like you. I really want to spend some time with you. Please can we have another date?

	3FDECFC7	Yeah, I blame you for what happened. You're just like the rest of them. Trying to keep an honest man like me down. Goodbye. - N

	41B7E0FD	Bye,
	4A4EDA16	What happened to you? Did you go off with some other internet bitch rather than meeting me?! Is that the kind of guy you are? Shop for women online like they're pieces of meat and then only go on dates with the leanest cuts? You make me sick. Go to that whore. I'm so much more real than her!
