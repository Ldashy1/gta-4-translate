	828E2278	I know I'm not being fair to you and that writing an email is the coward's way out. If your feelings for me are anything like mine for you, then this must be difficult to read. I have to look out for myself now and to do what I think will be best for me in the long time. Things have been hard recently - seeing a brother die and one get locked up. I kind of think that Packie is on a crash course to somewhere horrible, too. I'm just saying that... well... I need to break the cycle. I need to get out of this life and away from people who aren't healthy. Your life hasn't been easy and who you are is not your fault... I'm not punishing you for that. There's no way you are going to be able to change. It would be unreasonable of me to expect you to. Have a nice life, Niko. I hope you find happiness.
