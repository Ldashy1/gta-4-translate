	B7683485	Ok, man. Maybe I'll check this girl out. I'm thinking she's either rejected you or she's crazy because I know you haven't suddenly become Mr. Faithful to Mallorie. - N
	B65DAB8A	See ya later

	BA63A127	Just saw this freaky dirty girl on <a href="www.blogsnobs.org">www.blogsnobs.org</a>. She's called LiberatedWoman. It seems that if you write about all your sexing on the internet you can be as big a slut as you like and no one gives you any shit for it. Desperate men all over America have got to thank the internet and shows like I'm Rich for that, cousin! You should try to meet her. If it wasn't for Mallorie, these fingers would be squeezing on her titties and not writing an email to you - I'll tell you that!
	A5D99168	You love trying to get me involved with freaks online, don't you? I'm alright, cousin. - N
	A39A8604	See ya later

	AC398523	Good to see you online cousin! And good to know you in this country, by my side - the Bellic boys showing the world what is up. Man, if our two idiotic, useless, bullying fathers could see us now! They'd turn in their miserable graves! Fuck them. We made it, man. This country is ripe for the plucking. I'm really glad you're here. Listen - we are going to take this shit over, baby!
	ABFD045A	Cousin, I am so sorry. I don't know what to say. You should have followed my advice, not become fixated with revenge. Give up, please. I am begging you.
	A9D6B798	Niko,
	F295C19F	Roman, how are you ever going to rule the world if you gamble every cent you get away?
	F00F8464	Thanks for dating advice.
	E523243C	Have you been stealing Brucie's juice, cousin? We should try to get out of debt first.
	FE24A8F8	Fuck you! It was two chicks. I never dated a man. Unlike you!
	FB16DA17	Niko,
	F90830DE	See ya later
	C6D7BA5F	Listen, cousin, give that Michelle a call I know she likes you, and you need to get some action. She's a nice girl. You've got her number - call her up.
	C6784BBF	See ya later
	C64DF086	Niko,

	D84EEF6C	See ya later
	D64F58FE	Shit! Michelle was working for someone? Fuck... I don't know what to say.
	98941513	Niko,
	273189AB	Cousin, I am so happy for you. I imagine Brucie will be pissed off - missing out on all those threesomes.
	2434F518	Great news! Mallorie agreed to marry me! I am so happy. I am going to be a family man. I am so excited - we have had our ups and downs, but she's been a good friend, and once I stopped cheating on her and we became exclusive, it's been great. I cannot wait to marry her. One problem - no more threesomes!
	20CE9B92	Get realistic, cousin. I fucked things up in the Old Country. I fucked things up in Europe. Chances are I'm going to fuck things up here.
	369B2BFF	See ya later

	08E0EE35	You're a moron. Stop gambling. You don't have bad luck, you have bad judgment.

	1CE0DE06	I can think for myself, Roman. Thanks.
	127B51A5	I hereby make you a minority shareholder in R.B.E. - I'm the C.E.O. - we're in business, cousin!
	73E40D15	PLACEHOLDER
	6EC27666	You set me up with a man, and you set me up with a cop. Maybe you should give up the match making, you moron.
	615C5B9A	Maybe you could say that you're a moron and you won't set me up with anymore undercover agents or cops.

	372EA9A1	Good for you, cousin. Not so good for Mallorie having to sleep with you for the rest of her life though. Maybe she'll let you bring in some more men for threesomes after a while.
	5ECEA189	Niko,
	4831CF2C	See ya later
	46C63A36	Listen, thanks for doing that. I didn't think you'd mind dating a guy after all that time in the merchant navy. Brucie is really grateful. He'll be a good contact for us. Anyway, listen, I know you'll be mad, but I've been having a run of bad luck. The thing about luck is it changes, so maybe you can bail me out? Nothing crazy. Think of it as an investment.
